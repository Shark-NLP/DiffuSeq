IWSLT 2014 evaluation campaign: training/development data

# Copyright: TED Conference LLC
# License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0

For each language pair x-y, the in-domain parallel training data is
provided through the following files:

train.tags.x-y.x
train.tags.x-y.y

They include transcripts and manual translations of the talks
available at the TED website for each pair x-y in January 2014. The
talks included in the development (and forthcoming evaluation) sets
have been removed.

The transcripts are given as pure text (UTF8 encoding), one or more
sentences per line, and are aligned (at language pair level, not
across pairs). The simplified set of characters is employed for
Chinese text, and no segmentation/preprocessing has been applied.

Monolingual training data is included in the file:

train.y

while for tuning/development purposes, the following files are
released:

IWSLT14.TED.dev2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT14.TED.dev2010.x-y.y.xml
IWSLT14.TED.tst201[012].x-y.x.xml
IWSLT14.TED.tst201[012].x-y.y.xml

with the exception of the pairs: 
- German-English: the TEDX.dev2012 is additionally released
- Italian-English: the TEDX.dev2014 is additionally released
- Slovenian-English: only two development sets (dev2012 and tst2012)
  are released.

Below further information about released files is provided.

aligned.

UTF8 encoding is used.  The simplified set of characters is employed
for Chinese text, and no segmentation/preprocessing has been applied.
