<title>Biotechnik für alle: Rüdiger Trojok at TEDxRheinMain </title>
<seg id="1"> Yes , hello . </seg>
<seg id="2"> I’m happy to be here . </seg>
<seg id="3"> Yes , so , what is biohacking ? </seg>
<seg id="4"> I’ll have to provide some background information here , biohacking deals with modern molecular biology . </seg>
<seg id="5"> I study molecular biology and have been doing research into biohacking for a few years now , I started doing this because I simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what I’d learned theoretically into practice . </seg>
<seg id="6"> So these were my prime motives . </seg>
<seg id="7"> So it was curiosity and I somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it . </seg>
<seg id="8"> I think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future . </seg>
<seg id="10"> There are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields . </seg>
<seg id="11"> Now there’s Craig Venter in the USA who’s trying to produce biofuel , biodiesel fuel made from algae . </seg>
<seg id="12"> And then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes . </seg>
<seg id="13"> And the list can go on forever . </seg>
<seg id="14"> And So because of my interest in the in this technology , I went delved into it more . </seg>
<seg id="15"> So what Why hacking ? </seg>
<seg id="16"> Most of us know Most people have heard of this in the context of software . </seg>
<seg id="17"> Computer hacking , and then in the media it’s Yes , hackers break into a place and steal data and so on . </seg>
<seg id="18"> That’s rather sad for the hacker community , because it doesn’t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what’s behind it . </seg>
<seg id="19"> Software hackers started building computers in the seventies and eighties and this gave rise to the Internet . </seg>
<seg id="20"> And it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way . </seg>
<seg id="21"> And a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of posing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better . </seg>
<seg id="22"> And it was it developed in the area of software , but it’s also found in the electronics sector where you also find a whole tinkerer scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuits . </seg>
<seg id="23"> And so now you find it in biology , and I’d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology, Biology is actually an information science because the DNA code is an abstract code that yes , it’s not exactly like a computer , because it’s more dynamic , because it’s material , I mean real material , and not just cybernetic . </seg>
<seg id="24"> But it’s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also hack into it , that’s it , and I thought think it’s incredibly fascinating , and I just wanted to really delve into that . </seg>
<seg id="25"> These these networks didn’t really take form until two thousand eight . </seg>
<seg id="26"> There’s hackteria dot org , which originally comes from Switzerland , and it’s a network based in Europe with a cooperation in India , but it has members and active people all over the world by now . </seg>
<seg id="27"> Those are it has a more arty character , so it’s many artists and philosophers are working , together with scientists , on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively , there are museum exhibitions and , well, all sorts of things . </seg>
<seg id="28"> But the point is to always find a a really loose approach to it , to deal with it playfully . </seg>
<seg id="29"> And then there’s do-it-yourself-bio- dot-org , DIY bio . </seg>
<seg id="30"> That’s a network from the USA , that’s more of a kind of a forum , where you where people can meet and discuss things online . </seg>
<seg id="31"> They are geared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it , and so you see more, well, practical questions being asked . </seg>
<seg id="32"> Based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which I’d like to briefly describe . </seg>
<seg id="33"> This picture on the left is of Biocurious , that’s a hackerspace , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to . </seg>
<seg id="34"> Children , elderly people , all sorts of people go there to simply examine this in a different kind of way , they’ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory protocols . </seg>
<seg id="35"> Here in the bottom left there’s a group in Indonesia , House of Natural Fibers it’s called , but they’ve been around for quite some time . </seg>
<seg id="36"> For a longer time than these other two networks . </seg>
<seg id="37"> They look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes, also electronic tinkering , and combine this in a very outlandish way . </seg>
<seg id="38"> A group from Ankara , that I came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain DNA to people . </seg>
<seg id="39"> And in this other image at the top I have a lecture in in Copenhagen at the Medical Museion in combination with an exhibition on the topic . </seg>
<seg id="40"> And That’s , well That’s These are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody , is this fascination with technology . </seg>
<seg id="41"> And what you can do with it and approaching society very targetedly and asking, right, okay, what do you know, what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ? </seg>
<seg id="42"> So , okay , to hack into biology , you need material . </seg>
<seg id="43"> You need biological materials , but you also need tools, and that’s a laboratory . </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones, extremely distant ones, for professional staff, trained academics with a doctor’s degree etc. only . </seg>
<seg id="45"> And our approach was to say , okay, that you don’t actually have to do that . </seg>
<seg id="46"> That’s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that’s really true . </seg>
<seg id="47"> And So with this premises with this premises , Brian Degger in England , for example , tried to set up a mini-laboratory , took a pressure cooker , a hot plate and , yes , soup stock , and bred bacteria with it , working like this . </seg>
<seg id="48"> So anybody who’s ever had a soup gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this . </seg>
<seg id="49"> I then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so I bought some secondhand equipment on eBay and did a little DNA analysis , and tried to do a paternity test, so DNA fingerprinting in other words , at home again . </seg>
<seg id="50"> That’s not supposed to be a joke , but Here in the image below you can see there’s the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in Paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there. I’d like to briefly mention a project . </seg>
<seg id="51"> That here is Biocurious , the hackerspace I mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology . </seg>
<seg id="52"> And yes , so you can see that it’s a relatively relatively heterogeneous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big I mean , larger organisations , who are doing this more formally in an institutionalised form already . </seg>
<seg id="53"> But always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible . </seg>
<seg id="54"> The first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “scene” , and we’re online , and we we know the people who are always chatting there and everything . </seg>
<seg id="55"> And then the founder of do-it-yourself-bio dot org came and said: okay </seg>
<seg id="56"> we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organised two events , one in London , in two thousand ten , and shortly after that in the USA , in San Francisco . </seg>
<seg id="57"> And , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ? </seg>
<seg id="58"> And what what are our values and what are what are our objectives , our fundamental principles ? </seg>
<seg id="59"> And then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct . </seg>
<seg id="60"> That was really intuitive , I mean , everyone expressed their wishes , their and things that move them . </seg>
<seg id="61"> Then , in my opinion , a really good code was created . </seg>
<seg id="62"> And that was then It’s not binding , but it’s yes , I think it has managed to become accepted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes . </seg>
<seg id="63"> And then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but somehow it wasn’t really well received there . </seg>
<seg id="64"> So I think we from the biohacker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the academic world . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ? </seg>
<seg id="66"> A project I set up myself with the Hackteria network in Switzerland , was one in which we wanted to create a so-called optical trap or optical tweezers . </seg>
<seg id="67"> This is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they’re then trapped in there , so it’s basically like a tractor beam . </seg>
<seg id="68"> That really works , it’s done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a webcam , dismantled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold magnification approximately . </seg>
<seg id="69"> You can see this at the bottom . </seg>
<seg id="70"> And then we took apart a DVD burner and took out the burner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera . </seg>
<seg id="71"> And unfortunately that didn’t work , but we learned a lot in doing so anyhow . </seg>
<seg id="72"> Another project , that came from from the French group in Paris , did work , and that’s pretty cool . </seg>
<seg id="73"> He took one of these well, one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an EEG or something like that , so he was working with neurobiology , his his nickname is Sam Neurohack . </seg>
<seg id="74"> He then made this this this helmet , and it took place in in cooperation with the museum . </seg>
<seg id="75"> Visitors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this helmet . </seg>
<seg id="76"> Their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the roomwent switched on . </seg>
<seg id="77"> Was a very a very fancy project . </seg>
<seg id="78"> Another thing from the USA that also had to do with paternity test thing , is the the PCR , the Polymerase Chain Reaction, a complicated term . </seg>
<seg id="79"> This is about the copying of genes , replicating genes , DNA , fragments , so that you can make them visible . </seg>
<seg id="80"> so when I now That’s what the what profilers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair samples , and then they make these implement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like that . </seg>
<seg id="81"> And the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercially , they start at about four thousand euros at the least . </seg>
<seg id="82"> And that’s not within the range of amateurs , but it’s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot . </seg>
<seg id="83"> So that’s just one application among many that you can use . </seg>
<seg id="84"> And they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said, okay , we can make this easier and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so freely available hardware and electronics and they’re now the they’ve now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="85"> I think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so . </seg>
<seg id="86"> It’s certainly now it’s That’s still not cheap , but it’s certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible . </seg>
<seg id="87"> So that was a very successful hack in my opinion . </seg>
<seg id="88"> A project I recently started was the building of a gene gun . </seg>
<seg id="89"> A gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which shoots about this far , two centimetres or so . </seg>
<seg id="90"> You charge gold particles with DNA and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then I shot at onions and made them light up and stuff like that . </seg>
<seg id="91"> So the device you see here didn’t work . </seg>
<seg id="92"> But that’s my my prototype , which looked pretty wild though, on a branch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke . </seg>
<seg id="93"> Then I took a whipped cream dispenser and connected it to that . </seg>
<seg id="94"> A whipped cream dispenser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , I think about forty to sixty bar . </seg>
<seg id="95"> And with that you can accelerate the particles strongly enough and then they enter the onions . </seg>
<seg id="96"> And the commercial device for this starts at about fifteen thousand euros or so , whereas whipped cream dispensers cost about fifty euros . </seg>
<seg id="97"> So the It’s not as efficient , but it’s basically doable . </seg>
<seg id="98"> So that’s currently the the core objective of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and comprehensibility , so that that more people can get involved . </seg>
<seg id="99"> Because as I said in the beginning , it’s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it . </seg>
<seg id="100"> Because if you just read about it in secondary literature , that’s not the same as when you’ve done it yourself or have seen it being done . </seg>
<seg id="101"> And I think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies . </seg>
<seg id="102"> And if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology . </seg>
<seg id="103"> And And you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it . </seg>
<seg id="104"> And this trades under the names Open Knowledge and Citizen Science . </seg>
<seg id="105"> So as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies . </seg>
<seg id="106"> And that's that's the core concern of of biohackers . </seg>
<seg id="107"> Those are the people who are at least officially registered on the website , the DIY-bio-dot-org-website . </seg>
<seg id="108"> There's already a rather impressive number of people worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="109"> And it's also interesting that they're also represented in South-East-Asia . </seg>
<seg id="110"> That is I think they are Less people have registered than actually exist . </seg>
<seg id="111"> I know of some people who haven't registered . </seg>
<seg id="112"> And they are just the biohackers , individuals . </seg>
<seg id="113"> Some of them are also registered together with the hackerspaces , those places . </seg>
<seg id="114"> And that's just the beginning . </seg>
<seg id="115"> Like I said , it all just started in two thousand eight . </seg>
<seg id="116"> And hackerspaces , so computer hackerspaces , C-base in Berlin was the first , in nineteen ninety-five . </seg>
<seg id="117"> And that's become a gigantic network of very good , well , infrastructure centres , which are being represented all over the world . </seg>
<seg id="118"> And of course we hope that we'll expand in a similar way and also be similarly networked , so that more people can get involved. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And I would like to invite everyone to work on it and event try something yourselves . </seg>
<seg id="120"> It's not that simple , but it's also not impossible , and if you're curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far . </seg>
<seg id="121"> Thanks for listening . </seg>
<seg id="122"> That was all . </seg>

<title>Zurück in die Zukunft: Andrea Krajewski at TEDxRheinMain </title>
<seg id="1"> Yes , hello . </seg>
<seg id="2"> How do we humans actually function ? </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relevance in the area of in the research area usability and especially in the area user experience . </seg>
<seg id="4"> There, the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible . </seg>
<seg id="5"> I think that interactive media address archaic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media . </seg>
<seg id="6"> And this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transports you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our archaic roots . </seg>
<seg id="7"> So what are archaic models ? </seg>
<seg id="8"> I wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Archaic models are models that we adopted in pre-industrial times . </seg>
<seg id="10"> Intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality . </seg>
<seg id="11"> That might sound unusual at first . </seg>
<seg id="12"> I will clarify this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too, do have a natural relation to virtuality . </seg>
<seg id="13"> And the second aspect is that since we because of these archaic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual manner , although we use a codified language today . </seg>
<seg id="14"> And the third area speaks for itself really . </seg>
<seg id="15"> We all know that interactive media is , by definition , non-linear , which involves the negation of linearity , and which of course tells us that we consider linearity normal today . </seg>
<seg id="16"> The fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on . </seg>
<seg id="17"> But how is it with with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ? </seg>
<seg id="18"> I would like to prove that to you . </seg>
<seg id="19"> How many doors does the house you live in have ? </seg>
<seg id="20"> We You wouldn’t be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment . </seg>
<seg id="21"> In your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many doors there are . </seg>
<seg id="22"> That is exactly what you are doing . </seg>
<seg id="23"> You are virtualising the reality without a computer . </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fantastic , isn’t it ? </seg>
<seg id="25"> At the media campus , for example , we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this . </seg>
<seg id="26"> And this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-industrial times bitterly needed , because they didn’t have anything . </seg>
<seg id="27"> They didn’t have books, after all . </seg>
<seg id="28"> And they didn’t have photolithography . </seg>
<seg id="29"> They didn’t have mass media . </seg>
<seg id="30"> The only thing they had was their mind . </seg>
<seg id="31"> And in this mind they had memory . </seg>
<seg id="32"> In this mind knowledge was retrieved , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too . </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that’s why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtuality . </seg>
<seg id="34"> The interesting thing about this is that I can make a short trip . </seg>
<seg id="35"> Yes , that’s possible . </seg>
<seg id="36"> The interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simultaneously the media producer and medium . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Now let’s take that a step further . </seg>
<seg id="38"> What is the media today ? </seg>
<seg id="39"> You will notice that a change has taken place . </seg>
<seg id="40"> But I’ll come back to that in a moment . </seg>
<seg id="41"> A crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Shamans , priests , so-called keepers of knowledge , were specially assigned to preserve knowledge in stories . </seg>
<seg id="43"> And today we are still very , very dependent on stories . </seg>
<seg id="44"> According to the author of the book The Storytelling Animal , Jonathan Gottschall , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the reception of stories . </seg>
<seg id="45"> That means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life receiving stories . </seg>
<seg id="46"> Now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the lap of our parents . </seg>
<seg id="47"> No , no , that’s way off . </seg>
<seg id="48"> That goes back a lot further , to the pre-industrial cultures . </seg>
<seg id="49"> What is particularly impressive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we’ve anchored the ability to think in a non-linear way in our biological memory . </seg>
<seg id="50"> I brought along an example of the North American tribe of the Nootka Indians . </seg>
<seg id="51"> They live lived in the coastal region of British Columbia . </seg>
<seg id="52"> And as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navigate through there , from island to island , to find food . </seg>
<seg id="53"> And they did this using so-called lead maps . </seg>
<seg id="54"> Perhaps you’ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the Australian aboriginals . </seg>
<seg id="55"> They have similar principles . </seg>
<seg id="56"> They don’t have lead maps , but used so-called songlines , or dreampaths </seg>
<seg id="57"> And the interesting thing about that is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs . </seg>
<seg id="58"> And for them language had inferior importance . </seg>
<seg id="59"> That means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm . </seg>
<seg id="60"> And these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point . </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why do we no longer sing to get from A to B from above ? </seg>
<seg id="62"> At least not to navigate . </seg>
<seg id="63"> What What happened there ? </seg>
<seg id="64"> What happened is the the so-called machine age . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Before this , we were in the so-called age of feudalism . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photolithography . </seg>
<seg id="67"> And what happened is that we transferred the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to external media . </seg>
<seg id="68"> To the book and to the image . </seg>
<seg id="69"> The consequence of this is that we’ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise . </seg>
<seg id="70"> Virtuality has suddenly become something alien to us </seg>
<seg id="71"> and has nothing more to do with reality . </seg>
<seg id="72"> Bruce Brown , a famous design researcher at Brighton University , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not TV , the Internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise . </seg>
<seg id="73"> Let’s make a short provisional appraisal . </seg>
<seg id="74"> From the age of feudalism to the to the machine age . </seg>
<seg id="75"> What has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ? </seg>
<seg id="76"> Those are the declining influences of the pre-industrial cultures . </seg>
<seg id="77"> And they will they have been increasingly overwritten during the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age . </seg>
<seg id="78"> That means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories . </seg>
<seg id="79"> We no longer produce . </seg>
<seg id="80"> We have an abstract an abstracted language . </seg>
<seg id="81"> We no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codify them through language . </seg>
<seg id="82"> We’ve got used to things happening in a linear fashion . </seg>
<seg id="83"> And we’ve accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non-linearity . </seg>
<seg id="84"> What’s left is storytelling . </seg>
<seg id="85"> We’re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage . </seg>
<seg id="86"> The question is , what will come next ? </seg>
<seg id="87"> We had the age of feudalism , we have had the machine age and we are now stepping into the so-called cyber age . </seg>
<seg id="88"> That sounds very spacey and like science fiction , I know . </seg>
<seg id="89"> But the concepts of the cyber age , they are returning these these possibilities to rediscover our abilities . </seg>
<seg id="90"> This is about virtuality , about non-linearity , about storytelling . </seg>
<seg id="91"> I’d like to explain that a little more . </seg>
<seg id="92"> There are technical concepts such as “augmented reality” . </seg>
<seg id="93"> So if you think of the Google glasses for example , then that’s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Another example is so-called virtual reality As crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non-existent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the holodeck . </seg>
<seg id="95"> And other Another example are the ambient , intelligent systems . </seg>
<seg id="96"> Those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently . </seg>
<seg id="97"> All that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real living space . </seg>
<seg id="98"> To finish , I brought along , and I hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final bachelor’s projects by Michael Burk , Ann-Kathrin Krenz , Joris Klause and Jan-Moritz Müller . </seg>
<seg id="99"> The last two mentioned are also present today . </seg>
<seg id="100"> Perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to . </seg>
<seg id="101"> I brought this project along as an example to illustrate how these archaic , cognitive models are being addressed again . </seg>
<seg id="102"> The whole thing is a game , I must add . </seg>
<seg id="103"> Which of course very much accommodates for storytelling , and it’s a computer game . </seg>
<seg id="104"> And when I say "computer game" , you probably are imagining a number of persons people jumping around in front of some game consoles or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game console . </seg>
<seg id="105"> In any case , you imagine it happening inside . </seg>
<seg id="106"> This is a game for outside . </seg>
<seg id="107"> And it was expressly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to rediscover the real world . </seg>
<seg id="108"> And this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world . </seg>
<seg id="109"> I’m sorry I have to keep this so short . </seg>
<seg id="110"> You can explain this much more elaborately later on , as there’s more much more to this . </seg>
<seg id="111"> The point of the game is that I discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned positively or negatively on Twitter . </seg>
<seg id="112"> And so I can have a very different view of the city , a very different impression , because I see negative and positive zones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city . </seg>
<seg id="113"> We can take a look at that now . </seg>
<seg id="114"> Ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we’re about to see . </seg>
<seg id="115"> Of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that’s obvious . </seg>
<seg id="116"> Using a kind of torch , we can make these virtual worlds visible . </seg>
<seg id="117"> Right , I’d like to summarise my my presentation by stating that the characteristics and abilities that we acquired during the age of feudalism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be reactivated with the help of the so-called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products . </seg>
<seg id="118"> Thank you . </seg>

<title>A Touch of Curiosity: Wolfgang Henseler at TEDxRheinMain </title>
<seg id="1"> Yes , I'm very happy to be here . </seg>
<seg id="2"> I was just asked whether this sack is a talking sack and will talk for me . </seg>
<seg id="3"> It won't . </seg>
<seg id="4"> I'll be revealing what's inside of it in a moment . </seg>
<seg id="5"> But for now I'll just keep up the suspense . </seg>
<seg id="6"> Yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers . </seg>
<seg id="7"> I'm a designer from birth , so of course I deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn transforms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a jolt et cetera. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That's a whole series of things you're concerned with besides your existence as a designer . </seg>
<seg id="9"> When professors become curious , they are often shoved into a research semester . </seg>
<seg id="10"> And that's happened to me these last six months . </seg>
<seg id="11"> A research semester on the topic Natural User Interface Design . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now you'll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , archaic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And now I'll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive . </seg>
<seg id="14"> And against that background , within the area of Natural User Interface Design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the I mean in the relationship between humans and computers , I looked into how our tools , or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant . </seg>
<seg id="15"> So I looked into when things are natural and intuitive . </seg>
<seg id="16"> Perhaps we should take another look at this . </seg>
<seg id="17"> Why does this happen in the first place ? </seg>
<seg id="18"> So if we look at the development of our society , summarised briefly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form . </seg>
<seg id="19"> From the modern to the computer society . </seg>
<seg id="20"> Each society is characterised by one primary medium . </seg>
<seg id="21"> In the beginning there was the tribal society , characterised by language . </seg>
<seg id="22"> That means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same cave or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this tribal society . </seg>
<seg id="23"> But the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very lively . </seg>
<seg id="24"> It was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it successively and relatively naturally . </seg>
<seg id="25"> That was then replaced by the classical age and the first type of abstraction . </seg>
<seg id="26"> That was a massive outcry at the time , because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing , meaning that I took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it . </seg>
<seg id="27"> Depending on how and when I carve , a very different kind of coverage comes into being compared to when someone expresses it in a lively form , so to speak . </seg>
<seg id="28"> But gradually the written form became the primary medium , and gained a foothold . </seg>
<seg id="29"> Then the next generation came , which is where we're still primarily at . </seg>
<seg id="30"> That's the medium of print with Gutenberg and others . </seg>
<seg id="31"> That was also an affront at the time , where the gentry , clergymen and others said: Have you gone mad, If the people start to read , they'll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course . </seg>
<seg id="32"> And now we're going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we're really in this in this phenomenal phase at the moment , the fact that we're experiencing it . </seg>
<seg id="33"> Of course it totally confuses us , because on the one hand we're seeing this new media , socil social media , facebook etc . </seg>
<seg id="34"> With its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking: Don't say that there's now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena , because I want to cover that up and not confess to it . </seg>
<seg id="35"> And these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clashing with each other at the moment . </seg>
<seg id="36"> The exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanisms , principles and archaic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tribal society . </seg>
<seg id="37"> But now it's not on the local level , but on the global level . </seg>
<seg id="38"> We've understood that weather is global . </seg>
<seg id="39"> That the theme of ecology is a global theme . </seg>
<seg id="40"> Not , if I am environmentally aware here on the local level and the neighbour is less environmentally aware , the whole thing will no longer work . </seg>
<seg id="41"> That means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles: as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete transparency . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when , now it's happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level . </seg>
<seg id="43"> We're accumulating our knowledge on a global level and we're accumulating it increasingly quicker and better , for example . </seg>
<seg id="44"> Just like it used to happen in the village . </seg>
<seg id="45"> Against that background I looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forgotten, and what is instinctive for us , so what difference does it make ? </seg>
<seg id="46"> Because people often come and ask, can't you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ? </seg>
<seg id="47"> So you have to examine what that means , and not only change it so that it's different , because it needs to be improved too . </seg>
<seg id="48"> And to see when something is intuitive of course and how I , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are A user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use . </seg>
<seg id="49"> So even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and perceptual psychology . </seg>
<seg id="50"> And of course that's something where you start and look and say, okay , let me look into the inner self . </seg>
<seg id="51"> And how does it look in there ? </seg>
<seg id="52"> And how do we function , when we look in there ? </seg>
<seg id="53"> And what does intuitive mean and how do our channels of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Like Steve Jobs once said: You need to dig deeper to understand how it works . </seg>
<seg id="55"> So you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friendly or intuitively manageable , and what does that mean fundamentally . </seg>
<seg id="56"> And there you see that , that people A our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven officially recognised senses , and in the near future the next , the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again . </seg>
<seg id="57"> And to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ? </seg>
<seg id="58"> And just to say , what is information ? </seg>
<seg id="59"> Information is every difference that makes a difference . </seg>
<seg id="60"> Many people use the word but don't know what it means in detail . </seg>
<seg id="61"> But I have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that I know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally manageable as possible . </seg>
<seg id="62"> And of course how design affects perception . </seg>
<seg id="63"> We can see that here, when I design things , then I can design them in a confusing way , as you can see here on the right , where I can't tell which one is salt and which one is pepper , or I can basically design them intuitively , by showing things . </seg>
<seg id="64"> So a lot more naturally , and though they're in a container , I can directly see which one contains salt and which one contains pepper . </seg>
<seg id="65"> And if I say to someone , pass me the salt or the pepper , they'd have to first think about what's in what with the right one . </seg>
<seg id="66"> With the left they'd just intuitively grab it and then pass me the salt , as it hopefully won't be sugar . </seg>
<seg id="67"> But our perception , how it deceives us too . </seg>
<seg id="68"> For example perception in this context . </seg>
<seg id="69"> The right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn't at all , they're actually equally big , and yet our perception changes , depending on the context we place things in . </seg>
<seg id="70"> Does anybody know what this is ? </seg>
<seg id="71"> Come on . </seg>
<seg id="72"> Pattern recognition should also work . </seg>
<seg id="73"> Here Here it's more likely to turn into my glasses . </seg>
<seg id="74"> So it's a circle . </seg>
<seg id="75"> A second circle is starting to correlate or associate a certain similarity . </seg>
<seg id="76"> And if I then place a half oval next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another . </seg>
<seg id="77"> This is called a law of design or Gestalt psychology , which in turn affects our perception . </seg>
<seg id="78"> For the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design . </seg>
<seg id="79"> The law of proximity , the law of of continuity, etc . </seg>
<seg id="80"> They are usually forgotten by the third term . </seg>
<seg id="81"> But it's an essential component , if you want to design things as intuitively as possible . </seg>
<seg id="82"> The next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight . </seg>
<seg id="83"> That might sound mundane at first , but it's exciting , once you take a closer look at it . </seg>
<seg id="84"> So we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back . </seg>
<seg id="85"> That's wrong . </seg>
<seg id="86"> First you see from back to front . </seg>
<seg id="87"> Because you project an assumption that you're seeing something you recognise to the front, such as a circle . </seg>
<seg id="88"> That means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say, okay , </seg>
<seg id="89"> I have this cognitive feedback , you projected something you want to see . </seg>
<seg id="90"> And that's what's there , and comes back again . </seg>
<seg id="91"> Then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn't trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see . </seg>
<seg id="92"> And then it goes back to the back and it's not until then that whatever it is is actually seen . </seg>
<seg id="93"> So it's a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the span of milliseconds in which these things happen . </seg>
<seg id="94"> I don't know if any of you know this image . </seg>
<seg id="95"> The same thing that I just described is now happening . </seg>
<seg id="96"> Everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern . </seg>
<seg id="97"> I don't know who recognises what . </seg>
<seg id="98"> Does anyone see anything specific ? </seg>
<seg id="99"> A Dalmatian , exactly . </seg>
<seg id="100"> Once you've seen that that that you can see a Dalmatian in this , you know it . </seg>
<seg id="101"> You'll never forget it again , because I'm showing where the Dalmatian is . </seg>
<seg id="102"> Now you see the Dalmatian . </seg>
<seg id="103"> And , what's more , you'll now always see it . </seg>
<seg id="104"> That means I've corrupted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and I've conditioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this obscure image . </seg>
<seg id="105"> And that's the projection of seeing , feedback , seeing . </seg>
<seg id="106"> Now I know it and project the fact that I'm seeing a Dalmatian to the front . </seg>
<seg id="107"> Then I see the Dalmatian . </seg>
<seg id="108"> So these are really exciting processes , which take place accordingly in this , well , it's not really a grey area , but in this rose-tinted area . </seg>
<seg id="109"> Does anyone know what three seconds are ? </seg>
<seg id="110"> A long time , yes . </seg>
<seg id="111"> That's our present . </seg>
<seg id="112"> So it's always interesting to know as a designer . </seg>
<seg id="113"> If I know something takes three seconds , until I slide from the present into the past so to speak , then I am well capable of bridging waiting times , in that he in that I keep someone occupied for three seconds . </seg>
<seg id="114"> He will have to process that as the present . </seg>
<seg id="115"> Then it will turn into the past and , in that way , I can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegant way , if I know this phenomenon . </seg>
<seg id="116"> What takes twenty-five milliseconds ? </seg>
<seg id="117"> Yes , milliseconds . </seg>
<seg id="118"> Another very exciting phenomenon . </seg>
<seg id="119"> It's the time it takes to fall in love with someone . </seg>
<seg id="120"> That means, attention, now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because I will not be held responsible for what might happen . </seg>
<seg id="121"> And sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon . </seg>
<seg id="122"> That's the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have . </seg>
<seg id="123"> That means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perceive things . </seg>
<seg id="124"> And the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accordingly . </seg>
<seg id="125"> Of course designers don't only look at the topic of perceptions and neural processes or cognitive ergonomics , but primarily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course . </seg>
<seg id="126"> So how do humans deal with certain objects . </seg>
<seg id="127"> On the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so formal aspects or formal aesthetic aspects . </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are indicator functions , where I know exactly where I have to look . </seg>
<seg id="129"> But there are also symbolic functions; why does someone spend such horrendous sums of money on such a little bag that you can hardly fit anything into , even when it's not very practical ? </seg>
<seg id="130"> We're more on the symbolic , on the semantic level there, something we designers are also preoccupied with . </seg>
<seg id="131"> Going back to my actual topic Natural User Interface and the topic that's behind that is Usability of course. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Usability always means how can I reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satisfying way possible . </seg>
<seg id="133"> That's what the norm says . </seg>
<seg id="134"> How can I make something as user friendly as possible ? </seg>
<seg id="135"> Can I handle it directly or do I need a manual or a correspondent training . </seg>
<seg id="136"> And then it's less usable or user friendly. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Making it differently or prettier doesn't mean it's easier to use . </seg>
<seg id="138"> That's something we have to understand . </seg>
<seg id="139"> And if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you'll understand why ninety-nine percent of today's software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable , including the iPad in many areas or the iPhone , although it's already a lot more intuitive than classical software . </seg>
<seg id="140"> Intuitive usability didn't start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when Apple appeared on the scene , if I wanted to make technological devices usable for people . </seg>
<seg id="141"> Why ? </seg>
<seg id="142"> Because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of usability , so natural user interfaces . </seg>
<seg id="143"> You need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you'd only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software . </seg>
<seg id="144"> That probably doesn't mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your employer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours . </seg>
<seg id="145"> But what I want to say is that for us it is of course accordingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things . </seg>
<seg id="146"> If we go back to the area of software , here you see the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems . </seg>
<seg id="147"> Then came the next ones , which already worked with a neural model or mental model , as software ergonomists say , because you'd have a conception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable . </seg>
<seg id="148"> So no more zeros and ones with cryptic codes , but a metaphor . </seg>
<seg id="149"> That made the whole thing considerably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better . </seg>
<seg id="150"> The next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behaviour a lot more . </seg>
<seg id="151"> So , as a designer , I design behaviour much more much more often than appearance . </seg>
<seg id="152"> That's also a paradigm shift . </seg>
<seg id="153"> That I can suddenly That the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and usability is becoming an application . </seg>
<seg id="154"> And if I go a step further in these natural user interfaces , where I can control things via voice , speech , touch and gesture rather than a mouse and cursor , then I am even faster and more immediate . </seg>
<seg id="155"> But that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive ? </seg>
<seg id="156"> If they become more intuitive and then I have to rough-handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive ergonomics , when is something really intuitive ? </seg>
<seg id="157"> And that's For us humans , something is intuitive when there's an as little as possible a need to think about it . </seg>
<seg id="158"> So apparently humans don't like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves . </seg>
<seg id="159"> The less I think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is . </seg>
<seg id="160"> And what does that mean to a designer ? </seg>
<seg id="161"> It means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then I can make use of that as a designer . </seg>
<seg id="162"> That means I can transfer an intuitive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software considerably more user friendly . </seg>
<seg id="163"> That poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now I've already given it away . </seg>
<seg id="164"> It's the so-called OSIT model . </seg>
<seg id="165"> We all use it , and OSIT is an acronym that stands for Orient , Select , Inform , Transact . </seg>
<seg id="166"> Every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you're doing it unconsciously and , well , pretty intuitively and also instinctively in part . </seg>
<seg id="167"> The model already takes shape while you're still in your mother's womb and it's intercultural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present . </seg>
<seg id="168"> OSIT in itself is used by us fifty to seventy thousand times depending on the activity , it was ascertained that when you sleep it is strained less than in the day . </seg>
<seg id="169"> I can transfer this performance model Orient , Select , Inform , Transact to an interaction system . </seg>
<seg id="170"> And this kind of transferal , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action . </seg>
<seg id="171"> And that's on a higher grail of user friendliness than the transferal of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desktop . </seg>
<seg id="172"> And if I now transfer this , if I let Orient take shape as an overview , Select as a selection , Inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and I can look at in detail , and yes , Transact means I can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping, etc. , </seg>
<seg id="173"> and then I can transfer the whole thing . </seg>
<seg id="174"> I'll try to do that using an example . </seg>
<seg id="175"> Everybody was having some cake earlier . </seg>
<seg id="176"> Overview: I'm interacting with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in . </seg>
<seg id="177"> I get the entire overview , can filter this and can say, now show me all the things with chocolate, for example . </seg>
<seg id="178"> And suddenly I have an interface that is considerably more intuitive and natural . </seg>
<seg id="179"> Because the fact that I can grab hold of things like these little pieces , that I can touch them and they come to me , is considerably more natural than when I am able to make these things accessible via hierarchically organised websites or other mechanisms so to speak . </seg>
<seg id="180"> Imagination is more important than knowledge , and I'd like to close on that sentence A and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions , and so I thank you warmly for your attention and please . </seg>

<title>Cradle to Cradle: Michael Braungart at TEDxRheinMain </title>
<seg id="1"> I'd like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity . </seg>
<seg id="2"> Firstly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have , right ? And depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents , your curiosity is of course awakened . </seg>
<seg id="3"> And curiosity can't be learned . </seg>
<seg id="4"> That's why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteristic that can't be learned . </seg>
<seg id="5"> My objective is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , forty years of The-Club-of-Rome , into quality . </seg>
<seg id="6"> And there's one central point here . </seg>
<seg id="7"> And that has to do with phosphorus . </seg>
<seg id="8"> Give pee a chance . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Every day you release+ you release in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to absorb two grams of phosphorus . </seg>
<seg id="10"> Otherwise you couldn't have teeth . </seg>
<seg id="11"> And you wouldn't be able to save energy . </seg>
<seg id="12"> You wouldn't be able to have bones . </seg>
<seg id="13"> We'd only be able to float in the earth's seas as amorphous molluscs. </seg>
<seg id="14"> If , in fact , we couldn't absorb and release phosphorus . </seg>
<seg id="15"> Incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn't at all . </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because everybody's talking about energy , but nobody's talking about the phosphorus problem . </seg>
<seg id="17"> The phosphorus problem is much more critical . </seg>
<seg id="18"> We are dependent on two countries . </seg>
<seg id="19"> We only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In the last twenty years alone , fifteen thousand tonnes of uranium was put onto our fields in Germany . </seg>
<seg id="21"> And we absorb all of it . </seg>
<seg id="22"> It causes leukemia in children . </seg>
<seg id="23"> And we think we're protecting the environment when we do a little less damage . </seg>
<seg id="24"> So , for example, protect the environment , drive the car less . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Protect the environment , produce less rubbish . </seg>
<seg id="26"> Protect the environment , consume less energy . </seg>
<seg id="27"> But that's not protection . </seg>
<seg id="28"> That's like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five . </seg>
<seg id="29"> It's just a little less destruction . </seg>
<seg id="30"> If that's our thinking from from the cradle to the grave , then our our entire planet will become a cemetery sooner or later . </seg>
<seg id="31"> That's why we need to think from cradle to cradle . </seg>
<seg id="32"> And the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all . </seg>
<seg id="33"> The ground stores over sixty percent of the planet's carbon . </seg>
<seg id="34"> At the moment we're growing corn and losing between eleven and thirty kilograms thirty tonnes per hectare , if you were to calculate it per square metre . </seg>
<seg id="35"> That means we're losing five-thousand times more than what is formed in the soil . </seg>
<seg id="36"> Of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all . </seg>
<seg id="37"> And everything is either the packaging or the contents . </seg>
<seg id="38"> In Offenbach , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of nappies . </seg>
<seg id="39"> And as we get older , the nappies get bigger . </seg>
<seg id="40"> +That is They're all in the pre-nappy stage , so to speak . </seg>
<seg id="41"> Right ? </seg>
<seg id="42"> One A baby needs about six-thousand nappies . </seg>
<seg id="43"> We can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ? </seg>
<seg id="44"> China can make up for that in one second . </seg>
<seg id="45"> It's entirely insignificant . </seg>
<seg id="46"> So the question is , how should we deal with nappies ? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs . </seg>
<seg id="48"> I'd like to tell you why . </seg>
<seg id="49"> Because with pigs , phosphorus is released in their solid components faeces . </seg>
<seg id="50"> With people , it is released in the urine . </seg>
<seg id="51"> Yes . </seg>
<seg id="52"> So humans can't be pigs . </seg>
<seg id="53"> That proves it , doesn't it ? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Traditionally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet . </seg>
<seg id="55"> And if you deny people the if you deny people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren't here at all , people become grabby and hostile . </seg>
<seg id="56"> And so you have someone like Al Gore , one of our great heroes , saying : There is nothing more important than stabilising the human population . </seg>
<seg id="57"> In Israel people say , if you save a human life , you're saving the world . </seg>
<seg id="58"> On our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better . </seg>
<seg id="59"> Yes . </seg>
<seg id="60"> The first question is , are there really too many of us ? </seg>
<seg id="61"> If you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants weigh four times as much a people . </seg>
<seg id="62"> I could also mention termites , but in the USA nobody likes termites , although they're vegetarians . </seg>
<seg id="63"> So ants weigh more than we do . </seg>
<seg id="64"> And because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people . </seg>
<seg id="65"> That means there are not too many of us , we're just too stupid , you see ? </seg>
<seg id="66"> And when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why Offenbach , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty , right ? </seg>
<seg id="67"> You can only be climate neutral if you don't exist , you see ? </seg>
<seg id="68"> That's your only chance . </seg>
<seg id="69"> Have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ? </seg>
<seg id="70"> Have you ? </seg>
<seg id="71"> Just one single one ? </seg>
<seg id="72"> That means our entire intelligence amounts to us wanting to be more stupid than trees, you see ? </seg>
<seg id="73"> You see ? </seg>
<seg id="74"> There is not one single tree that is carbon neutral . </seg>
<seg id="75"> Thankfully , right ? </seg>
<seg id="76"> There's no problem with overpopulation among trees . </seg>
<seg id="77"> There are still six hundred billion trees in the Amazon Forest alone . </seg>
<seg id="78"> Of those Have you ever heard of overpopulation of trees ? </seg>
<seg id="79"> So all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees . </seg>
<seg id="80"> And then you see that even something like Demeter , the strictest organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn't allow for our own metabolic waste to be returned . </seg>
<seg id="81"> Every year we lose about three tonnes of phosphorus , which should really be circulated . </seg>
<seg id="82"> And so there are too many of us . </seg>
<seg id="83"> Just because of that . </seg>
<seg id="84"> That means we feel so guilty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no Bioland, no Nature-et-Progrès or whatever they're all called, that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle . </seg>
<seg id="85"> Isn't that sad ? </seg>
<seg id="86"> And that means there are too many of us . </seg>
<seg id="87"> It certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil . </seg>
<seg id="88"> But where are we of use ? </seg>
<seg id="89"> We try to minimize our ecological footprint , but the point is to have a big footprint that's of use . </seg>
<seg id="90"> We want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most honourable thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ? </seg>
<seg id="91"> Zero emissions , you see ? </seg>
<seg id="92"> You can only have zero emissions if you don't exist . </seg>
<seg id="93"> Even if you were to shoot yourself now , you'd still have emissions . </seg>
<seg id="94"> So you can't solve that . </seg>
<seg id="95"> We can do it differently . </seg>
<seg id="96"> We can win back our nutrients . </seg>
<seg id="97"> With the agriculture we practice in Brazil in which we win back nutrients . </seg>
<seg id="98"> This is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture . </seg>
<seg id="99"> We do it in China for example, where we directly take the waste produced from it . </seg>
<seg id="100"> In In China a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ? </seg>
<seg id="101"> And in our Western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients . </seg>
<seg id="102"> This means that the entire history of Western civilization is characterized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers . </seg>
<seg id="103"> So the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients from increasingly distance places . </seg>
<seg id="104"> That's why all Western empires just kept on expanding until they couldn't manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imploded . </seg>
<seg id="105"> You see ? </seg>
<seg id="106"> It was different in China . </seg>
<seg id="107"> They managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutrients . </seg>
<seg id="108"> Even today , if you get invited to dinner in China , people expect you to stay on after the meal until you need to use the toilet . </seg>
<seg id="109"> Because it's unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you . </seg>
<seg id="110"> You were You were invited to dinner , not to steal nutrients . </seg>
<seg id="111"> That means you can see how to win back nutrients on the Internet . </seg>
<seg id="112"> The nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate biogas , on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it , raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish . </seg>
<seg id="113"> And the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the favelas goes down by over ninety percent . </seg>
<seg id="114"> So we don't have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible . </seg>
<seg id="115"> We can support them in doing good . </seg>
<seg id="116"> That's high-tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves . </seg>
<seg id="117"> The side product is clean water . </seg>
<seg id="118"> And they're designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily . </seg>
<seg id="119"> That means the rate of crime goes down . </seg>
<seg id="120"> And none of these plots , and we've built over one hundred fifty of them in the last twenty years , none of these plots was every sabotaged . </seg>
<seg id="121"> It would be easy to just throw a litre of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ruined for years . </seg>
<seg id="122"> That doesn't happen . </seg>
<seg id="123"> That means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible . </seg>
<seg id="124"> We can support them in doing good . </seg>
<seg id="125"> So we must get the phosphorus back . </seg>
<seg id="126"> And by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in Germany the most suitable purification plant is the one in Frankfurt . </seg>
<seg id="127"> Unfortunately not the one on Offenbach , but perhaps you can give the Frankfurters a hand . </seg>
<seg id="128"> Because the plant in Frankfurt would be the best at winning back phosphorus . </seg>
<seg id="129"> And it must go back . </seg>
<seg id="130"> We can see that phosphorus is really critical . </seg>
<seg id="131"> And we can see that it can be done . </seg>
<seg id="132"> In Holland we've been working on this for over three years now . </seg>
<seg id="133"> The Dutch government has stated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosphorus . </seg>
<seg id="134"> But we need this everywhere . </seg>
<seg id="135"> You see , there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus reservoirs worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="136"> There's the OPEC , a a bunch of amateurs . </seg>
<seg id="137"> It consists of twenty-six member countries that control forty percent of all the oil deposits . </seg>
<seg id="138"> And oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources . </seg>
<seg id="139"> But phosphorus will not be able to be replaced . </seg>
<seg id="140"> That's why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right . </seg>
<seg id="141"> And it's the first question to ask is what is right . </seg>
<seg id="142"> So it's about effectivity, not efficiency . </seg>
<seg id="143"> In Holland it's easier to understand this , because Holland built the country on flowers . </seg>
<seg id="144"> You see ? </seg>
<seg id="145"> Imagine your your wife is sad , because you upset her , and you turn up with fifty roses . </seg>
<seg id="146"> Totally inefficient . </seg>
<seg id="147"> But totally effective , right ? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Or take lipstick . </seg>
<seg id="149"> A woman in Germany swallows about six point three kilos of lipstick in her lifetime . </seg>
<seg id="150"> Whereas . </seg>
<seg id="151"> And that Scientifically speaking , that's not not exactly correct , because because we don't know how much is kissed away . </seg>
<seg id="152"> But I can tell you , even in this light , that lipstick is totally inefficient , but very effective , you see ? </seg>
<seg id="153"> A All the beautiful things in life are inefficient . </seg>
<seg id="154"> So that's why we're not talking about resource efficiency , but effectivity . </seg>
<seg id="155"> To ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ? </seg>
<seg id="156"> Not burning the biosolids a little more , storing them and losing all the materials for the cycles in the incineration plant , but asking oneself , how do you close cycles ? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Imagine Mozart being efficient . </seg>
<seg id="158"> Right? </seg>
<seg id="159"> If I invite you over for dinner and I say : Yes , we're having a pill with Offenbach taste and a glass of water to go with it . </seg>
<seg id="160"> Wonderful , right ? </seg>
<seg id="161"> That's efficient . </seg>
<seg id="162"> Everything that's nice in life is not efficient . </seg>
<seg id="163"> When you fall in love with someone , efficient ? </seg>
<seg id="164"> Yes ? </seg>
<seg id="165"> That means that everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing . </seg>
<seg id="166"> The whole environmental discussion . </seg>
<seg id="167"> We tell people , oh well , you people in the South are not environmentally aware . </seg>
<seg id="168"> No , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential . </seg>
<seg id="170"> But the wrong things . </seg>
<seg id="171"> If you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem . </seg>
<seg id="172"> To what We're thinking from a Northern perspective . </seg>
<seg id="173"> Every footprint is disadvantageous there . </seg>
<seg id="174"> When you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground . </seg>
<seg id="175"> Because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil . </seg>
<seg id="176"> But if you're in Italy , every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer . </seg>
<seg id="177"> So it's about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wetland . </seg>
<seg id="178"> Not guilt management . </seg>
<seg id="179"> We say sustainability in Germany . </seg>
<seg id="180"> Right? </seg>
<seg id="181"> But if I would ask you , how is your wife ? </seg>
<seg id="182"> What would you say ? </seg>
<seg id="183"> Sustainable . </seg>
<seg id="184"> Then I would say , my warm condolences , you see ? </seg>
<seg id="185"> That's just about the minimum . </seg>
<seg id="186"> So not saving , abstaining from , avoiding . </seg>
<seg id="187"> Every bit of waste is a nutrient . </seg>
<seg id="188"> And a pleasure too , if you look at how people in Italy throw out a can of Coca-Cola from their car window . </seg>
<seg id="189"> That's a funny occurrence , you know . </seg>
<seg id="190"> It's a type of territorial behavior , right ? </seg>
<seg id="191"> You can show that you were there . </seg>
<seg id="192"> But with the right design , please . </seg>
<seg id="193"> We've designed an ice cream wrapping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature . </seg>
<seg id="194"> You can throw it anywhere you want . </seg>
<seg id="195"> In two hours it's biodegraded , wherever it is . </seg>
<seg id="196"> And it contains seeds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you're contributing to biodiversity . </seg>
<seg id="197"> That means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful . </seg>
<seg id="198"> So two cycles are created . </seg>
<seg id="199"> Of course not everything should be compostable . </seg>
<seg id="200"> A TV or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don't expend them . </seg>
<seg id="201"> Only things that are subject to wear and tear , such as shoe soles , brake coverings , car tyres , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems . </seg>
<seg id="202"> Things that are only used go into technical systems . </seg>
<seg id="203"> But today we're just talking about biological systems . </seg>
<seg id="204"> Right ? </seg>
<seg id="205"> Let's take sneakers for example , right ? </seg>
<seg id="206"> Direct advertising , and not necessarily for the company Puma , but to help this company make these products successful . </seg>
<seg id="207"> Because we don't We no longer make things free of stuff . </seg>
<seg id="208"> Right ? </seg>
<seg id="209"> So if I invite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn't help you at all . </seg>
<seg id="210"> No , we define what's inside . </seg>
<seg id="211"> Positively . </seg>
<seg id="212"> So not like a detox . </seg>
<seg id="213"> There's nothing poisonous in it . </seg>
<seg id="214"> Everything that's inside can be utilized . </seg>
<seg id="215"> These are the first shoes with which you make a jackrabbit start at the pedestrian lights and the rubber sole can go into biological cycles , okay ? </seg>
<seg id="216"> It's all compostable all of it . </seg>
<seg id="217"> And if we manage to do it , we'll of course manage to do it for Adidas , for Nike , for Hennes and Mauritz and the whole textile industry . </seg>
<seg id="218"> And half of the wastewater problem worldwide is caused by the textile industry . </seg>
<seg id="219"> So you're helping out there , just ask the people . </seg>
<seg id="220"> Hey , Puma , do you are you really serious ? </seg>
<seg id="221"> Because they changed their chairman of the board of directors twice now . </seg>
<seg id="222"> And I'm not so sure they're going to stick with it . </seg>
<seg id="223"> So give me a hand here . </seg>
<seg id="224"> It is possible though . </seg>
<seg id="225"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> That which I just presented to you . </seg>
<seg id="227"> It's possible . </seg>
<seg id="228"> Today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tear , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles . </seg>
<seg id="229"> There are also technical cycles . </seg>
<seg id="230"> There's the a direct returning system for this . </seg>
<seg id="231"> It's the first biological rucksack , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle . </seg>
<seg id="232"> That too , so you can get back those things in any shop . </seg>
<seg id="233"> If you think about it , right ? </seg>
<seg id="234"> Remember those nappies again ? </seg>
<seg id="235"> If At the moment they're waste . </seg>
<seg id="236"> These nappies are everywhere practically . </seg>
<seg id="237"> In those countries where people have money . </seg>
<seg id="238"> They're on the rubbish tips , but also elsewhere in the landscape , right ? </seg>
<seg id="239"> If we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cellulose base , you'll be able to plant one hundred and fifty trees in Israel or Tunisia with one baby . </seg>
<seg id="240"> Right ? </seg>
<seg id="241"> If you just take these these nappies , shred them , sterilize them and take the powder to plant trees with it . </seg>
<seg id="242"> That makes the baby carbon-positive for its whole life , right from the beginning . </seg>
<seg id="243"> So we don't need to be climate neutral , we can be climate-positive . </seg>
<seg id="244"> It's about making a beneficial poop print . </seg>
<seg id="245"> Yes, so to speak . </seg>
<seg id="246"> Right ? </seg>
<seg id="247"> We can do that . </seg>
<seg id="248"> We can re-invent things all over again . </seg>
<seg id="249"> I founded an institute with this in mind . </seg>
<seg id="250"> Today , it has many employees and they can all get involved . </seg>
<seg id="251"> There's also an extra association , the Cradle-to-Cradle-Institute , where everybody can get involved . </seg>
<seg id="252"> So no more saving , abstaining from , avoiding , reducing , no more guilt management , but intelligent waste . </seg>
<seg id="253"> Does that make you curious ? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Thank you . </seg>

<title>Die Arbeit des Interpreten: Yayoi Takano-Beck at TEDxStuttgart </title>
<seg id="1"> The work of the interpreter . </seg>
<seg id="2"> Music as language . </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the description of my presentation , it is written that I , as an interpreter , see myself as a translator , in the English sense of the word . </seg>
<seg id="4"> Interpreters are translators of the written notes in resounding music . </seg>
<seg id="5"> Everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can’t just simply render a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful translation can occur . </seg>
<seg id="6"> Translating from German into English can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it’s the translation of literature or even poetry . </seg>
<seg id="7"> What we musicians do with our musical language is very alien to non-professionals . </seg>
<seg id="8"> As an interpreter of a piece of music I only have the musical notes at first . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Now you probably think that the composer , when writing down the notes , already includes everything they’ve thought of . </seg>
<seg id="10"> In reality the notes are very vague and imprecise . </seg>
<seg id="11"> These notes are about as precise or imprecise as the verbal description of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely precise . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Because you can’t smell the flowers in the verbal description of a landscape , you can’t guess the shade of green , you can’t hear or feel the whispering of the wind . </seg>
<seg id="13"> This means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audible , concrete , non-verbal musical language . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today I’d like to verbally translate what I usually translate into music , or interpret . </seg>
<seg id="15"> So you could call it the translation of a translation . </seg>
<seg id="16"> That’s why I prefer to do it all in German , because if I’d have to translate it into English , that would be like the translation of the translation of the translation . </seg>
<seg id="17"> The So , music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion . </seg>
<seg id="18"> The annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language . </seg>
<seg id="19"> So it’s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string . </seg>
<seg id="20"> Those would just be the letters you learned to write . </seg>
<seg id="21"> You don’t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language . </seg>
<seg id="22"> So you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language . </seg>
<seg id="23"> There are different grades here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home, whether you only understand it passively or whether you can also actively speak it , all the way to the musical native speaker . </seg>
<seg id="24"> The work of the interpreter starts off much like the work of a theatre director . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Once you’ve selected a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the composition’s creation . </seg>
<seg id="26"> You collect information about the piece in secondary literature . </seg>
<seg id="27"> You read letters , diaries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expressed by the composer themselves . </seg>
<seg id="28"> You study works that have been composed before or after . </seg>
<seg id="29"> You make comparisons . </seg>
<seg id="30"> The reasons for writing it . </seg>
<seg id="31"> How and what did they feel ? </seg>
<seg id="32"> What were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ? </seg>
<seg id="33"> All that interests me . </seg>
<seg id="34"> You imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period . </seg>
<seg id="35"> After a while , you already have a vast reservoir of knowledge surrounding the composer as an interpreter , and you listen to them regularly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the composer . </seg>
<seg id="36"> The composer increasingly becomes like a friend you’re living with . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece . </seg>
<seg id="38"> As the note is anything but a precise indication of the desire of a composer , and is , rather , a framework , I will now utilise this framework to fill it with sense and meaning . </seg>
<seg id="39"> Then I will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework . </seg>
<seg id="40"> I play to explain what these tones might have meant . </seg>
<seg id="41"> What they mean to me now , what they meant to the composer at the time and what they might have meant to them now . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Every note , every phrase is thus given a sense , because I feel it myself, because it comes from what I’ve personally experienced . </seg>
<seg id="43"> It has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise I won’t convince my audience that this is my desire . </seg>
<seg id="44"> It always makes for a happy concert when I have the fortune to experience the piece anew , even though I’ve been working on it for so long in advance . </seg>
<seg id="45"> It’s like experiencing a happy new day afresh , even though you go through the same rituals, getting up , having breakfast , going to work , I experience the same piece anew again and again . </seg>
<seg id="46"> I’m a day older , the seasons change , my pulse is slower in the evening than it is in the morning, in a concert hall it takes longer for the reverberation to return than it does at home . </seg>
<seg id="47"> I’m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously . </seg>
<seg id="48"> All this influences me and influences my experience of the composition . </seg>
<seg id="49"> It’s also really wonderful when I’m on stage with my musical other half and we’re on the same wavelength . </seg>
<seg id="50"> Then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation . </seg>
<seg id="51"> You introduce a new idea and this is answered instantaneously with a reaction . </seg>
<seg id="52"> It’s exciting , because things happen that we didn’t practice and we aren’t able to practice . </seg>
<seg id="53"> It’s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communicates in a lively way . </seg>
<seg id="54"> In this way , every concert is a different concert . </seg>
<seg id="55"> I will never again play as I did in this moment . </seg>
<seg id="56"> I won’t be able to play like I do today in twenty years . </seg>
<seg id="57"> I will have more life experience than today and so my musical palette will have many more nuances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now . </seg>
<seg id="58"> Sure , I will have thrown some colors away too , but I will have added new ones to take their place . </seg>
<seg id="59"> I have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this . </seg>
<seg id="60"> It happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher Professor Jürgen Ude , a well-known Beethoven specialist , concert pianist and longstanding professor at the conservatory here in Stuttgart . </seg>
<seg id="61"> I was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already retired before I finally started studying . </seg>
<seg id="62"> But I had the good fortune to meet him at a very young age , when I was thirteen , and so I always attended his courses while I was at school . </seg>
<seg id="63"> I was seventeen when I took part in a course of his and played the last of Chopin’s four ballads , one of his later works. </seg>
<seg id="64"> He asked me what the preamble to this ballad was in my opinion . </seg>
<seg id="65"> It’s a solemn part . </seg>
<seg id="66"> And , being young , I said , expectation . </seg>
<seg id="67"> He smiled and said , oh ? </seg>
<seg id="68"> That must be our difference in age . </seg>
<seg id="69"> Because to me it means memory . </seg>
<seg id="70"> He was over sixty at the time . </seg>
<seg id="71"> Well , at seventeen you still have dreams , but no significant memories . </seg>
<seg id="72"> Today , I play this piece every few years and it’s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed . </seg>
<seg id="73"> It’s exciting every time , because I read something new in it every time . </seg>
<seg id="74"> Another example from a very different field . Monet painted his Waterlilies an infinite number of times . </seg>
<seg id="75"> It’s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light . </seg>
<seg id="76"> He translated the waterlilies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment . </seg>
<seg id="77"> His personal impressions of the waterlilies . </seg>
<seg id="78"> A piece of music that is interpreted for the umpteenth time is comparable in this way . </seg>
<seg id="79"> Now I am also older than Chopin when he wrote the piece at thirty-two . </seg>
<seg id="80"> He only lived until the age of thirty-nine . </seg>
<seg id="81"> And it's important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if I think I know them by heart . </seg>
<seg id="82"> To maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer . </seg>
<seg id="83"> Because the notes are the only direct connection to him . </seg>
<seg id="84"> Especially if he's already dead . </seg>
<seg id="85"> So how do you start speaking the language of music ? </seg>
<seg id="86"> Like I said , you need about as much time as you do for a spoken language . </seg>
<seg id="87"> Usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons . </seg>
<seg id="88"> You practically first learn to read before you speak an a word . </seg>
<seg id="89"> You learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes . </seg>
<seg id="90"> When you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then tones come out , which , together , sound like music . </seg>
<seg id="91"> Once it's played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder . </seg>
<seg id="92"> Beginners' classes hardly talk about interpretation . </seg>
<seg id="93"> Well , so it says presto at the top , so that's a fast piece . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Lento , slow . </seg>
<seg id="95"> The loud and soft symbols , F and B , etcetera . </seg>
<seg id="96"> Most people here have heard of them . </seg>
<seg id="97"> But even if you implement these indications , it still just remains something technical . </seg>
<seg id="98"> And it still isn't an interpretation . </seg>
<seg id="99"> I'm surprised . </seg>
<seg id="100"> I'm surprised that people often forget something very elementary . </seg>
<seg id="101"> Which is that to make music on an instrument one's own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance . </seg>
<seg id="102"> Which is singing . </seg>
<seg id="103"> A child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own . </seg>
<seg id="104"> It's like learning to speak . </seg>
<seg id="105"> It's necessary to have one's own experiences and idea of music to then make it resonate through a further possibility , which is an instrument . </seg>
<seg id="106"> People who have never sung consequently never directly felt with their own body what it's like to create a tone . </seg>
<seg id="107"> To form a phrase with one's own breath . </seg>
<seg id="108"> The music instrument is an extension of our own body . </seg>
<seg id="109"> We use our vocal chords to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance . </seg>
<seg id="110"> So the hammerheads in the piano are the extensions of my fingers . </seg>
<seg id="111"> The melody is created through what's being sung and rhythm is created through dance . </seg>
<seg id="112"> The constant flooding of music today is not very beneficial there . </seg>
<seg id="113"> You no longer need to make music yourself when you're bored . </seg>
<seg id="114"> You no longer need to whistle or sing a song . </seg>
<seg id="115"> All one's own music is destroyed because you're constantly being bombarded by music from outside of yourself . </seg>
<seg id="116"> Sure there are some of you who will say , yes, but what do you do if if you can't sing ? </seg>
<seg id="117"> Then I ask you this , can you not sing , A , because you think you can't sing ? </seg>
<seg id="118"> Or B , Because you didn't learn how to sing ? </seg>
<seg id="119"> In both cases , it's not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to properly use these little muscles that attune the vocal chords . </seg>
<seg id="120"> Because you can train that . </seg>
<seg id="121"> Or C , Because you were told that you aren't suitable . </seg>
<seg id="122"> Then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ? </seg>
<seg id="123"> Did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nicely nowadays ? </seg>
<seg id="124"> Or D , You simply don't like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it . </seg>
<seg id="125"> Which I would very much regret , because music is a lovely , communicative thing . </seg>
<seg id="126"> But perhaps someone just needs to change your mind . </seg>
<seg id="127"> Well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hopeless candidate . </seg>
<seg id="128"> But please don't say , I don't understand a thing about classical music . </seg>
<seg id="129"> I can't say whether it's good or bad . </seg>
<seg id="130"> Then my answer is , but I'm sure you can say whether you like it or not . </seg>
<seg id="131"> Because I don't think anyone will say , I don't know whether I like the taste , because I can't cook . </seg>
<seg id="132"> So , you don't abstain from food just because you can't cook . </seg>
<seg id="133"> So you don't need to abstain from listening to classical music because you don't play an instrument . </seg>
<seg id="134"> Listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not . </seg>
<seg id="135"> Whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste . </seg>
<seg id="136"> Say what you feel . </seg>
<seg id="137"> With time , you will have demands and will want to have more spices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details . </seg>
<seg id="138"> Why do I demand from my audience that they listen actively ? </seg>
<seg id="139"> Because music is a language and music is there to communicate something . </seg>
<seg id="140"> A work of art that is never looked at will never gather the strength to have an effect . </seg>
<seg id="141"> One should eat the food that is lovingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it . </seg>
<seg id="142"> So please listen when music is played . </seg>
<seg id="143"> It is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise . </seg>
<seg id="144"> When a child grows up in an environment where the adults actively make music or at least actively listens to music , it's very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ? </seg>
<seg id="145"> Can you play it in blue now ? </seg>
<seg id="146"> And the child will play , after thinking for a moment . </seg>
<seg id="147"> And it will sound completely different from before . </seg>
<seg id="148"> That would be the very beginning of their own musical expression . </seg>
<seg id="149"> So the first step towards an interpretation . </seg>
<seg id="150"> And what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ? </seg>
<seg id="151"> Instruments have developed . </seg>
<seg id="152"> There was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in Bach's time . </seg>
<seg id="153"> It just hadn't been invented . </seg>
<seg id="154"> I think Bach would have been very enthusiastic if he'd had the tonal possibilities that today's modern pianos have . </seg>
<seg id="155"> I can make Bach's tonal ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a baroque harpsichord was not able to . </seg>
<seg id="156"> Of Beethoven we know that he listened more once he'd already gone deaf . </seg>
<seg id="157"> Today a modern orchestra can play anything that was rejected as unplayable at the time . </seg>
<seg id="158"> That's why composers depend on us interpreters to reinvent the pieces again and again . </seg>
<seg id="159"> So that what they had only conjured up in their minds becomes listenable . </seg>
<seg id="160"> And also anything they would conjure up in their minds today . </seg>
<seg id="161"> Or anything that I imagine because they might have thought . </seg>
<seg id="162"> Thank you . </seg>

<title>Mut zur Lüge: Klaus-Jürgen Grün at TEDxRheinMain </title>
<seg id="1"> Do you know what envy is ? </seg>
<seg id="2"> Were you ever envious ? </seg>
<seg id="3"> And how did you feel ? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Terrible . </seg>
<seg id="5"> I have a friend who drives a Passerati . </seg>
<seg id="6"> When I turn up in my little VW clunker and park next to it , I get this feeling . </seg>
<seg id="7"> Something shoots through my head . </seg>
<seg id="8"> I say , Ulf , why do you need such a big car ? </seg>
<seg id="9"> It will lose half of its value in one year . </seg>
<seg id="10"> And anyway , you work a lot less than I do . </seg>
<seg id="11"> Why do I have to get such a small car ? </seg>
<seg id="12"> And then it comes to me straight away , it's unfair . </seg>
<seg id="13"> It goes against justice . </seg>
<seg id="14"> And when I say the word justice , this feeling disappears . </seg>
<seg id="15"> Our organism has come up with an excellent method to make unpleasant feelings like envy simply disappear . </seg>
<seg id="16"> You can also try it with words like revenge or acquisitiveness and the like . </seg>
<seg id="17"> I would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you're probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level . </seg>
<seg id="18"> The mechanism comes from the lie . </seg>
<seg id="19"> But don't think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any intention of building a wall . </seg>
<seg id="20"> And then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked . </seg>
<seg id="21"> A lie like that shows you that the liar himself doesn't believe what he says . </seg>
<seg id="22"> And it's easily proven that he has something entirely different in mind . </seg>
<seg id="23"> He's only deceiving you and not himself . </seg>
<seg id="24"> No , the lie I'm talking about is one where you're deceiving yourself . </seg>
<seg id="25"> You need this lie to keep this sham , this self-deception , upright . </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is harder to check or bring down . </seg>
<seg id="27"> You need time . </seg>
<seg id="28"> An anecdote you might know talks about this time . </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Spanish painter Pablo Picasso once painted a portrait of a woman . </seg>
<seg id="30"> The woman then complained that the portrait didn't look anything like her . </seg>
<seg id="31"> Picasso's answer , just wait and see . </seg>
<seg id="32"> It will start to look more and more like you . </seg>
<seg id="33"> At this point and if you're laughing , you'll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us . </seg>
<seg id="34"> Because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie . </seg>
<seg id="35"> The artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can't see if she just looks in the mirror . </seg>
<seg id="36"> The artist is conveying something you can only get to know once you've looked at the work of art again and again . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Then that unpleasant feeling that it couldn't look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you . </seg>
<seg id="38"> Here you have this mechanism , with which we can use the lie as a grandiose invention to stabilize our living conditions . </seg>
<seg id="39"> And this turns up not only in art , but also in folktales , folktales , in in mythology , in stories . </seg>
<seg id="40"> Perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at herself in the mirror every day and said , who is the fairest of them all ? </seg>
<seg id="41"> One day this mirror says , yes, there is someone fairer than you . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Over the hills and all that . </seg>
<seg id="43"> And you also know how much hostility arises from this piece of truth , for the mirror can't lie , from this piece of truth . </seg>
<seg id="44"> But we should just realize that you can't tell a woman that there's a more beautiful one somewhere else . </seg>
<seg id="45"> It's necessary to always use what you would call political correctness here . </seg>
<seg id="46"> We need this lie here , to keep the deception upright , without which we wouldn't be able to go on living . </seg>
<seg id="47"> We don't only have such amazing lies in art and folktales , but also in science . </seg>
<seg id="48"> And here there's this story about the wife of the bishop of Worcester. </seg>
<seg id="49"> She heard about this book by Charles Darwin , The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man . </seg>
<seg id="50"> That humans are supposed to have descended from apes and that , yes ,there is at least one ancestor shared by both humans and apes . </seg>
<seg id="51"> Then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what Charles has written is not true . </seg>
<seg id="52"> That the human descended from apes and we have a shared ancestor . </seg>
<seg id="53"> No , no , that's not possible . </seg>
<seg id="54"> And if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it . </seg>
<seg id="55"> Why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Because we can't live our lives without this lie . </seg>
<seg id="57"> Because we want this self-deception , this feeling of being brilliant , descended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that’s unbearable for us . </seg>
<seg id="58"> So we can’t bear these things . </seg>
<seg id="59"> We have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they’re true . </seg>
<seg id="60"> To show you how slowly this mechanism disappears and to illustrate the traces it leaves , which lead to something other than this grandiose image of ourselves , I would like to share another story with you . </seg>
<seg id="61"> A particularly nice story , in my opinion . </seg>
<seg id="62"> My wife told me it . </seg>
<seg id="63"> One day she came back from her school , she’s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pupils . </seg>
<seg id="64"> An autistic pupil . </seg>
<seg id="65"> She likes him a lot , because he has the tendency to be forthright . </seg>
<seg id="66"> And she asked him , so what are your hobbies ? </seg>
<seg id="67"> And then he said , well, I’m with the fire brigade . </seg>
<seg id="68"> And because I’m with the fire brigade , I’m interested in pyrotechnical things . </seg>
<seg id="69"> Yes , you’ll sense it if you’re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right . </seg>
<seg id="70"> I told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something , we should try to replace it with the word although . </seg>
<seg id="71"> You do this and then you’ll see the sentence , although I’m with the fire brigade , I’m interested in pyrotechnical things . </seg>
<seg id="72"> You sense that that ‘s the actual truth behind the sentence . </seg>
<seg id="73"> A young lad like that , he’s not interested in putting out fires . </seg>
<seg id="74"> He’s interested in setting fires . </seg>
<seg id="75"> But there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire . </seg>
<seg id="76"> There’s only the second best option , which is the fire brigade . </seg>
<seg id="77"> That’s where he signed up . </seg>
<seg id="78"> And moreover , you don’t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up . </seg>
<seg id="79"> No , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we’re responsible for removing the danger that others create when they set a fire . </seg>
<seg id="80"> Here you have this little mechanism . </seg>
<seg id="81"> This This hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can’t say that out loud . </seg>
<seg id="82"> Here you have the censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which switches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others . </seg>
<seg id="83"> In this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness . </seg>
<seg id="84"> We know that something else is really true . </seg>
<seg id="85"> But we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed . </seg>
<seg id="86"> We can’t just do that . </seg>
<seg id="87"> It is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function . </seg>
<seg id="88"> I’d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute . </seg>
<seg id="89"> According to which logic do we disseminate this deception , this self-deception , this willingness to present a reality that’s different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ? </seg>
<seg id="90"> I would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illustrate this . </seg>
<seg id="91"> The first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don’t need at all . </seg>
<seg id="92"> I’m talking about the soul . </seg>
<seg id="93"> What is the soul ? </seg>
<seg id="94"> The soul is something mental , Leibniz said . </seg>
<seg id="95"> It does not have a tangible , material nature . </seg>
<seg id="96"> And when you are with people who are firmly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an incorporeal framework around you , and it’s not material , and you are just made of flesh and blood , are solid , so to speak , bound to the earth , ephemeral , subject to decay , insignificant , dead really . </seg>
<seg id="97"> And now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an airy nature , it’s called anima in Latin , being like a breath of air . </seg>
<seg id="98"> And when this breath of air pours out onto a human , the human is filled with dignity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul . </seg>
<seg id="99"> And then it can leave you . </seg>
<seg id="100"> That’s how people imagine the soul works . </seg>
<seg id="101"> That it comes to the human from outside . </seg>
<seg id="102"> We are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives . </seg>
<seg id="103"> And if you think of this condition , then you’ll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie . </seg>
<seg id="104"> Because now you can implement a rule of three . </seg>
<seg id="105"> You’ll remember the rule of three from school . </seg>
<seg id="106"> This is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us . </seg>
<seg id="107"> This , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation . </seg>
<seg id="108"> You’ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie . </seg>
<seg id="109"> Namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way . </seg>
<seg id="110"> This rule of three contains three theorems . </seg>
<seg id="111"> The first theorem is , Klaus claims there is no soul . </seg>
<seg id="112"> The second theorem is thus , if Klaus is right , then he doesn’t have a soul . </seg>
<seg id="113"> Now we have the third theorem . </seg>
<seg id="114"> I highlighted it here . </seg>
<seg id="115"> A third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul . </seg>
<seg id="116"> They will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can’t claim anything . </seg>
<seg id="117"> So you sense it already . </seg>
<seg id="118"> Here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse . </seg>
<seg id="119"> You see it straight away . </seg>
<seg id="120"> The first two theorems are logically correct . </seg>
<seg id="121"> I can claim anything . </seg>
<seg id="122"> Logic does not make any statements about reality . </seg>
<seg id="123"> I can say , the German Chancellor is a man . </seg>
<seg id="124"> And if I’m right , then the Chancellor is a man . </seg>
<seg id="125"> If I’m not right , then the Chancellor is not a man . </seg>
<seg id="126"> Logic does not make any statement about what is valid . </seg>
<seg id="127"> I can claim anything . </seg>
<seg id="128"> What is decisive , if I’m right , then it’s valid . </seg>
<seg id="129"> So when Klaus says , there is no soul . </seg>
<seg id="130"> Secondly , if he’s right , then he doesn’t have a soul . </seg>
<seg id="131"> These things are logically correct . </seg>
<seg id="132"> And now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , I can do something with this . </seg>
<seg id="133"> So it attaches a third theorem to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theorems and only acts as if the opposite of the first theorem had already been proven and given priority . </seg>
<seg id="134"> Because we’d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not . </seg>
<seg id="135"> But with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theorems are logically correct and attaches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie . </seg>
<seg id="136"> So we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul . </seg>
<seg id="137"> And we’re very happy about it . </seg>
<seg id="138"> We can apply these things to other examples . </seg>
<seg id="139"> At present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers . </seg>
<seg id="140"> Here you have to keep another philosophical theme , a philosophical slow-burner , close to hand . </seg>
<seg id="141"> That has to do with us going back to the fourteenth </seg>
<seg id="142"> century . </seg>
<seg id="143"> There was a scholar called Jean Buridan , and Buridan’s ass was named after him . </seg>
<seg id="144"> Buridan’s ass is an ass that is made purely of nature . </seg>
<seg id="145"> It doesn’t have this soul . </seg>
<seg id="146"> It’s a natural thing . </seg>
<seg id="147"> And if you put it exactly between two equally big haystacks , it will starve . </seg>
<seg id="148"> Because it doesn’t know which haystack it should go to first . </seg>
<seg id="149"> So it’s right in the middle . </seg>
<seg id="150"> That’s how things of nature are imagined . </seg>
<seg id="151"> Two equally large forces with opposite signsnatures will cancel each other out. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Nothing will happen . </seg>
<seg id="153"> Only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one haystack bigger than the other , then he doesn’t need any sense or anything else. </seg>
<seg id="154"> He’ll automatically go to the right thought . </seg>
<seg id="155"> If you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determined by the larger haystack that immediately attracts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will . </seg>
<seg id="156"> And as we’re here in Frankfurt am Main , I’ll remind you of the Max -Planck-Institute for brain research . </seg>
<seg id="157"> There’s a scholar there, his name is Wolf Singer , and sometimes people say, Wolf Singer claims, there is no free will . </seg>
<seg id="158"> Now we can come up with the second theorem and say : If Wolf Singer is right , then he has no free will . </seg>
<seg id="159"> These theorems are absolutely logical and correct . </seg>
<seg id="160"> And now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem . </seg>
<seg id="161"> It looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind . </seg>
<seg id="162"> Here you have it again . </seg>
<seg id="163"> Really , you’d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will . </seg>
<seg id="164"> But the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theorem were false from the start , so of course you’d have accept the opposite without any proof . </seg>
<seg id="165"> And now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie . </seg>
<seg id="166"> Practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predictors . </seg>
<seg id="167"> And don’t use the German word for predictors, which would be Prophet. </seg>
<seg id="168"> You mustn’t say that , because that would be a little politically incorrect . </seg>
<seg id="169"> Say , there are no predictors . </seg>
<seg id="170"> You’ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it’s a matter of course that there are predictors , you can’t prove that . </seg>
<seg id="171"> And you’ll have a problem right away . </seg>
<seg id="172"> Because while you are busy telling yourself that you can’t prove that there are no predictors , your counterpart will be very happy . </seg>
<seg id="173"> He’ll be very happy because he’s deceived you . </seg>
<seg id="174"> Because he led you down a path he’s not on himself . </seg>
<seg id="175"> Because this person is not interested in evidence at all . </seg>
<seg id="176"> He’s only interested in keeping himself free of the necessity to prove that there are predictors . </seg>
<seg id="177"> So through this mode of passing on the burden of proving something you are experiencing the brilliance of the lie . </seg>
<seg id="178"> And if you have another opportunity to enact this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don’t remind them of their self-deception. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Thank you for your attention . </seg>

<seg id="1"> Yes , hello . </seg>
<seg id="2"> I took the liberty I asked Lilly , if it would be okay to mention her . </seg>
<seg id="3"> She’s one of the organizers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea . </seg>
<seg id="4"> I must honestly say , and you witnessed this , I found it hard to talk about my idea at first . </seg>
<seg id="5"> And she said I should perhaps present my island project , which I will try to present to you . </seg>
<seg id="6"> But of course it’s the sum of a whole load of ideas . </seg>
<seg id="7"> I probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , I probably belong to the generation that created this bad ecological image , because I already started to study engineering at the technical university in Karlsruhe in nineteen seventy nine , I think it’s called KIT today . </seg>
<seg id="8"> And then I went to Berlin in the mid-eighties because I wanted to study renewable energies and they didn’t have that in Karlsruhe . </seg>
<seg id="9"> There was the Leopoldshafen nuclear research plant . </seg>
<seg id="10"> They were all called KFAs at the time , the place in Jülich was also called a KFA . </seg>
<seg id="11"> Today they’re called project executing organizations . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants . </seg>
<seg id="13"> But something stupid like a solar pendulum , which has an output of something like one hundred watt per square metre , that was a toy . </seg>
<seg id="14"> And in Berlin there was this crazy engineering collective . </seg>
<seg id="15"> I’m grateful to the person behind Premium Cola that he rehabilitated that word again , because after the Wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything left-wing was bad . </seg>
<seg id="16"> But it wasn’t like that in the eighties . </seg>
<seg id="17"> At that time , there were self-governing companies and one of them was in Kreuzberg in Mehringhof , where people thought evil took place . </seg>
<seg id="18"> A terrorist place , but it was was called Wuseltronik and it made wind and solar power and that’s where I started out in the mid-eighties . </seg>
<seg id="19"> And yes, a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statements were made , which I also was part of . </seg>
<seg id="20"> I worked in the collective for eleven years, it was based on a grassroots democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> We were a group of twenty people . </seg>
<seg id="22"> If one person said no , there was the veto principle , which was totally demoralising , for ten years, I I had grave doubts as to whether I was perhaps really wasting my great engineering degree on something ridiculous , also because all my father’s colleagues had told him , you wasted your money on your child . </seg>
<seg id="23"> He’s wasting his time on nonsense . </seg>
<seg id="24"> And that was really very , very bitter and then you end up in one of these phases just now you saw that image with Don’t give up written on it , where I asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand Deutschmark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the collective of course, whether that was really such a great thing . </seg>
<seg id="25"> And then I stuck to it until nineteen ninety six and then I became the co-founder of the company Solon together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufacturers in the world together with the spin-off Q-Cells . </seg>
<seg id="26"> A huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it's crazy again , it starts with people saying , what's this nonsense about, that won't work . I'm talking about storage . </seg>
<seg id="27"> I've brought along a project I'd like to introduce to you . </seg>
<seg id="28"> The title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renewable energies . </seg>
<seg id="29"> And we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could implement a reservoir wisely today . </seg>
<seg id="30"> On this island , that's the island Graciosa on Azores . </seg>
<seg id="31"> Yes, here is the data . </seg>
<seg id="32"> Four and a half thousand people live there . </seg>
<seg id="33"> They have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment . </seg>
<seg id="34"> The question is , why don't they have more ? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Because technologically it's just not possible . </seg>
<seg id="36"> If they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail . </seg>
<seg id="37"> That's what I always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in Berlin-Adlershof . </seg>
<seg id="38"> They then also say , why? </seg>
<seg id="39"> We have twenty percent in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="40"> That can't be a problem . </seg>
<seg id="41"> But that's not true , we have seven percent in Europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the European one . </seg>
<seg id="42"> If we had twenty percent in Europe , we'd immediately have the same problems the people on that island have . </seg>
<seg id="43"> The question is just , calculate that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out . </seg>
<seg id="44"> How big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to twenty , thirty , forty , fifty , maybe even seventy percent renewable energies. </seg>
<seg id="45"> And yes , I'll move on a slide . </seg>
<seg id="46"> The conventional system looks like this all over the world . </seg>
<seg id="47"> By the way , about one hundred gigawatts electrical output on diesel fuel basis is added in the world per year . </seg>
<seg id="48"> That's equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly . </seg>
<seg id="49"> The world's hunger for energy that we are seeing is relieved with diesel fuel , because you don't need a license for it . </seg>
<seg id="50"> It goes fast . </seg>
<seg id="51"> You put a box like this over there . </seg>
<seg id="52"> And that generally looks like this . </seg>
<seg id="53"> In it , there are always three diesels running , two are always maintained . </seg>
<seg id="54"> Yes , that's what a What you see at the bottom is the load . </seg>
<seg id="55"> We were given very accurate data . </seg>
<seg id="56"> And the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back-up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Our objective was to simply say , okay, </seg>
<seg id="58"> the diesel will be the back-up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part . </seg>
<seg id="59"> And if you want to exceed twenty , thirty percent renewable energies , you have to switch off diesel . </seg>
<seg id="60"> That means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energies can take over the entire network . </seg>
<seg id="61"> Of course you can only do that if you're being managed here somehow . </seg>
<seg id="62"> Nobody on this planet has done that in this way . </seg>
<seg id="63"> It exists on a small scale , so you can use your shaving machine in the car via a small power inverter . </seg>
<seg id="64"> People always ask me , what are you researching in Adlershof all the time ? </seg>
<seg id="65"> That is doable . </seg>
<seg id="66"> But if you want to hook up several of these power inverters and they are supposed to construct a network , it becomes highly complicated . </seg>
<seg id="67"> And our aim was , We wanted to reach seventy to ninety percent renewable energies and then this remainder is still here , the last remainder , the last ten , twenty percent renewable energies with , that will will be very , very expensive and generating this from batteries won't work either . </seg>
<seg id="68"> That will definitely be an energy carrier which will be hydrogen methane , power to gas you know alr, that's what it will be . </seg>
<seg id="69"> You will then rather have to go to a seasonal reservoir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night . </seg>
<seg id="70"> We just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run-of-the-mill electrochemical battery . </seg>
<seg id="71"> How far would you get with that ? </seg>
<seg id="72"> And then we tried out a whole load of simulations . </seg>
<seg id="73"> And we simulated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fifty cents per kWh after twenty years , you'd arrive at about forty-four cents . </seg>
<seg id="74"> Those were the first calculations six years ago . </seg>
<seg id="75"> And then we said, okay, </seg>
<seg id="76"> that's great , then we have a business model . </seg>
<seg id="77"> We're cheaper than the diesel system , if the price of diesel rises by five percent a year . </seg>
<seg id="78"> And then we started negotiating with the islanders . </seg>
<seg id="79"> What needed to be done ? </seg>
<seg id="80"> We negotiated with investors , I looked for new shareholders . </seg>
<seg id="81"> We were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the organisation . </seg>
<seg id="82"> And here you have the graphic again . </seg>
<seg id="83"> The brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system . </seg>
<seg id="84"> The fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn't break through to the other things . </seg>
<seg id="85"> And the Power Utility , which which the electric utility on the island , said they think it’s great . </seg>
<seg id="86"> They said , We want to support it, but we don’t think you can solve the technical problem . </seg>
<seg id="87"> And that’s why we decided to build a hall in Berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale . </seg>
<seg id="88"> That means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world . </seg>
<seg id="89"> Here it is . </seg>
<seg id="90"> Naturally it’s from Asia , in this case from Japan . </seg>
<seg id="91"> And funnily enough it was developed at the BBC Mannheim , called ABB today, in the seventies , and was then licensed to the Japanese . </seg>
<seg id="92"> It is You can see that it’s a very , very big battery . </seg>
<seg id="93"> It has a megawatt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it’s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation . </seg>
<seg id="94"> And then presented . </seg>
<seg id="95"> We also brought one of these diesel aggregates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here’s the big battery , here are all the converters , with which we simulate the network . </seg>
<seg id="96"> Over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system, the cable’s kilometer physics , to illustrate the vibration behavior , so to speak , in the network . </seg>
<seg id="97"> And here can you see the whole thing again . </seg>
<seg id="98"> We can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network . </seg>
<seg id="99"> We can see it again here We can see the diesel again here, and all the individual aggregates here . </seg>
<seg id="100"> And what we did , the hall was completed in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and twelve , we developed practically everything that could be developed electronically and in terms of software between the individual systems . </seg>
<seg id="101"> So we’re not battery manufacturers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two . </seg>
<seg id="102"> You have to be able to cater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated . </seg>
<seg id="103"> The nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anticipate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renewable energies . </seg>
<seg id="104"> So this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty-five-thirty percent excess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun . </seg>
<seg id="105"> Of course this lends itself to a smart grid . </seg>
<seg id="106"> Smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere . </seg>
<seg id="107"> We can start integrating electro-mobility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed . </seg>
<seg id="108"> That means that if you’re at seventy percent renewable energies , then you won’t be able to do that without a reservoir . </seg>
<seg id="109"> You can heed the share by using one of these smart grids , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you’ll never be able to do without the reservoir completely . </seg>
<seg id="110"> And that’s kind of the message . </seg>
<seg id="111"> That’s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise . </seg>
<seg id="112"> If we turn off the diesel , then you will no longer have this rotating mass , which causes a certain amount of idleness in the network . </seg>
<seg id="113"> And our European energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants , where the axle always revolves around the whole of Europe . </seg>
<seg id="114"> We look into this network , see the fifty hertz , and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz , we start to open a few small valves , then a little more steam can enter , and then it goes up again . </seg>
<seg id="115"> That’s the system . </seg>
<seg id="116"> And of course that’s incredibly slow . </seg>
<seg id="117"> If you put that down somewhere , it takes a while . </seg>
<seg id="118"> The spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable . </seg>
<seg id="119"> And in that time you can react differently . </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you don’t have this rotating mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electronics and electro-chemistry . </seg>
<seg id="121"> And with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds . </seg>
<seg id="122"> So you see what enormous potential for speed there is here . </seg>
<seg id="123"> And so the message is this, We have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc. </seg>
<seg id="124"> and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network . </seg>
<seg id="125"> Must-run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequency . </seg>
<seg id="126"> Yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , Additional construction of coal-burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn’t have , or gas turbines , because that’s not possible . </seg>
<seg id="127"> And we’re just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capacities , the must-run capacities , by putting electrochemical reservoirs in the network too . </seg>
<seg id="128"> Thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic . </seg>
<seg id="129"> And to this purpose people always come and look at our experimental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island . </seg>
<seg id="130"> And yes , the discussion always revolves around how much of the future you can anticipate . </seg>
<seg id="131"> And many discussions I had in the last six years were similar to the discussion I had in the last thirty years regarding photovoltaics . </seg>
<seg id="132"> You can’t do it , it’s nonsense , a plaything for kids , we calculated everything , it will never add up . </seg>
<seg id="133"> We have thirty gigawatt of photo-voltaic power in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="134"> That’s exemplary . </seg>
<seg id="135"> And I simply assume that we’ll have the same capacity of electrochemical reservoirs in the whole world for the next thirty years . </seg>
<seg id="136"> It’s simple , that’s what will happen . </seg>
<seg id="137"> There will be a whole load of resistance and arguments . </seg>
<seg id="138"> The nice thing is that I’ve experienced that scientists have been joining my side in the last couple of years . </seg>
<seg id="139"> We’ve been given over ten million funded projects, also to attach a ten-megawatt battery to the German network . </seg>
<seg id="140"> That will take place next April . </seg>
<seg id="141"> So you’re noticing a change is taking place , from a defensive attitude to to well , to the idea, one hundred percent renewable energies is right . </seg>
<seg id="142"> And when you have one hundred percent renewable energies , then it’s like a self-sufficient system . </seg>
<seg id="143"> Up till now the following is always argued in discussions , These islanders are becoming self-sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network . </seg>
<seg id="144"> The The question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are drilled out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they’re an island . </seg>
<seg id="145"> Then they’ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live . </seg>
<seg id="146"> And that is kind of our vision of sensible energy use and I am grateful to the Cradle to Cradle institute that they said , Use solar power . </seg>
<seg id="147"> And that’s what we’re doing , and so in this sense we’re coming together , also if you look at the presentation by Premium Cola , that it’s okay to be a collective and use solar power . </seg>
<seg id="148"> And yes , well , I’d just like to motivate you , in the sense that it’s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision . </seg>
<seg id="149"> And you really have to stay pretty firm while doing so , but I think it’s it’s possible . </seg>
<seg id="150"> Thank you . </seg>
