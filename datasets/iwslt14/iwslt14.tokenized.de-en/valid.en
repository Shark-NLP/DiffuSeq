what do you do when you have this sort of dis@@ rup@@ ted flow ?
ste@@ phen pal@@ um@@ bi : following the mer@@ cur@@ y tra@@ il
i really thought they were so bene@@ ath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third mani@@ pul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipu@@ late the ne@@ ck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introdu@@ ce you to jo@@ ey .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fing@@ ers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mi@@ key bre@@ tt , cra@@ ig , le@@ o , z@@ em jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in and bas@@ il and me .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sle@@ eping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the as@@ pi@@ ration is to fli@@ p these old assu@@ mp@@ tions , for phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fif@@ th categ@@ ories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social invest@@ ing .
it may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gen@@ ce of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental de@@ gra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden ten@@ sions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ hab@@ it in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work@@ places , fac@@ tor@@ ies , off@@ ices , etc .
the first gentle@@ man , he &apos;s a bak@@ er .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migra@@ tion , office .
they were living on top of the work@@ sh@@ ops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the whe@@ el of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehi@@ cles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonom@@ ously dri@@ f@@ ting car .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the ste@@ ering .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
so a few years ago , l@@ .@@ a. coun@@ ty decided that they needed to spend 2.@@ 5 billion dollars to re@@ pair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her home@@ town is called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virg@@ ini@@ a .
so these three guys all understand how to produ@@ c@@ tively chan@@ nel dollars through our local econom@@ ies to meet exi@@ sting market dem@@ ands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , rural and urban , play the oper@@ a@@ tional course of infrastructure -- things like waste dis@@ pos@@ al , energy demand , as well as social costs of un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , dro@@ p-@@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the im@@ pac@@ ts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frank@@ ly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to en@@ sure that the next generation of children born to afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans and asi@@ ans come out with cre@@ am@@ y skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achie@@ ving at a level that had never before been con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndro@@ me people inclu@@ des those who are ac@@ tors , those who are wri@@ ters , some who are able to live fully indepen@@ d@@ ently in adul@@ tho@@ od .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant pa@@ jam@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to en@@ sure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reach@@ es across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences refle@@ ct on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indi@@ cate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
and i came from a very privi@@ le@@ ged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very inten@@ sive on the progra@@ mming side .
you want a separate thing , like the a@@ c adap@@ tor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invi@@ te you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
and we &apos;re building upon innova@@ tions of generations who went before us .
but remember , gre@@ e@@ ce is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the sta@@ kes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that pres@@ ents a more difficult issue .
the phr@@ ase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8@@ -year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ist .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in con@@ gress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
the wir@@ ing from your sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shor@@ ter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cortex .
where are you feeling this ?
and also tri@@ um@@ ph , this sense of tran@@ scen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ex@@ pose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
no one &apos;s going to notice those spli@@ t lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these tri@@ g@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
now i think it &apos;s too easy .
we have se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed b@@ ad@@ ly , i would argue .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
you need to keep repe@@ ating the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religi@@ ons set up ritu@@ als around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzz@@ le@@ ment is struc@@ tural to con@@ temporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concern@@ s , tend to be isol@@ ated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collabor@@ ative .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agre@@ ed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ tely diff@@ er .
so it took me from places like chi@@ le -- the at@@ ac@@ ama desert in chi@@ le -- to si@@ ber@@ ia , to under@@ ground min@@ es in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a and even to the south pole .
you need something like tens of me@@ gat@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ trin@@ o .
the toi@@ lets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a woo@@ den sha@@ ck .
so this is us land@@ ing on the ross ice shel@@ f in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a .
the fabri@@ c alone wei@@ gh@@ s two tons .
an@@ il an@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y : what it takes to do extreme astro@@ physics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scop@@ e the problem . how big is it ?
and a boo@@ k@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satelli@@ te dis@@ h , a prin@@ ter , bin@@ der and cu@@ tter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-@@ library .
the ge@@ tty here is moving their books to the u@@ cl@@ a , which is where we have one these scan@@ ning centers , and scan@@ ning their out@@ -@@ of-@@ copy@@ right books , which is fab@@ ul@@ ous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a dis@@ k and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volu@@ me .
we ten@@ ded towards lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
so en@@ vision what it looks like all wra@@ pped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wra@@ pped up -- not quite so pretty .
and frank@@ ly , i face a big ob@@ stac@@ le .
but these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized sto@@ ma@@ chs and l@@ ung@@ s .
so , f@@ ung@@ i and my@@ ce@@ li@@ um sequ@@ e@@ ster carbon dio@@ xide in the form of cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , in the right conditions , produ@@ ces a mush@@ room -- it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ o@@ city that it can break as@@ p@@ halt .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
there &apos;s a v@@ et@@ ted press rele@@ ase that you can read -- it &apos;s v@@ et@@ ted by do@@ d -- if you google &quot; stam@@ ets &quot; and &quot; small@@ po@@ x . &quot;
so , the house is no longer su@@ it@@ able for invasi@@ on .
too many with@@ dra@@ w@@ als from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shu@@ t down .
so we had our own mini@@ ature rain@@ forest , a private beach with a coral re@@ e@@ f .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ating our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : sh@@ ri@@ mp far@@ ms .
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
and if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a diffic@@ ul@@ ty conne@@ cting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treat@@ ments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &apos;s another sign that we need p@@ it cre@@ ws , and that &apos;s the un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able cost of our care .
sk@@ ill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for bo@@ eing to help us .
there &apos;s a deep resi@@ stance because using these tools forces us to con@@ front that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to be@@ have with a different set of values .
and most of those los@@ ses are because of things we know .
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-@@ po@@ und pac@@ ka@@ ge of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the post@@ al office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-@@ po@@ und pac@@ k@@ ages of bees .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your col@@ on@@ ies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this se@@ gment of our industry .
and bees are very fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to rein@@ force some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a me@@ a@@ dow or living by a me@@ a@@ dow is transforma@@ tional .
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whi@@ st@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first re@@ he@@ ar@@ se with you your whi@@ st@@ ling .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young be@@ an that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they &apos;re going to be enter@@ ing this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people partici@@ p@@ ated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a sub@@ way station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shir@@ t or a black shir@@ t .
he gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he was@@ hed his hands before and after@@ ward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always en@@ su@@ red that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water can@@ ary ready for the field and to open-@@ source the hard@@ ware so that anyone can contribu@@ te to the development and the ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we can t@@ ack@@ le this problem together .
now why am i talking about co@@ ws ?
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is , just as we require reading , writing , ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic , american history , so we should have a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um on facts about all the religi@@ ons of the world -- about their history , about their cre@@ e@@ ds , about their tex@@ ts , their music , their symbo@@ li@@ sms , their pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , their requi@@ re@@ ments .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the she@@ ep &apos;s cle@@ vern@@ ess .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary .
and how can we do that ?
i &apos;m talking also about chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
well , this from &quot; the purpose driven life &quot; -- &quot; the bi@@ ble must become the auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative standard for my life , the comp@@ ass i rely on for direction , the coun@@ sel i listen to for making wise decisions and the ben@@ ch@@ mark i use for ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating everything . &quot;
now do we really want to com@@ mit ourselves to eng@@ ul@@ fing all the other religi@@ ons when their hol@@ y books are telling them , &quot; don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just sat@@ an talking ! &quot;
e@@ ars are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a l@@ oud voice , it &apos;s too l@@ oud .
first of all , listen consci@@ ously .
and my relationship to especially human@@ -@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circu@@ it off the pen@@ cil .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; we got@@ ta put a video out about this . &quot;
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pa@@ irs of hands , each following their own passi@@ ons , and each kind of like a mo@@ sa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ y@@ ards and in their kit@@ ch@@ ens .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical od@@ di@@ ty .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rock@@ ets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can es@@ cape .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glam@@ or@@ ous computer mod@@ el@@ ing .
and sur@@ ely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have mer@@ ged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habit@@ able planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multi@@ verse , in some other pat@@ ch of that multi@@ verse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated people that are rele@@ ased , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
from the fact that they are only ser@@ ving one audience , main@@ ly the western culture .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is rele@@ ased -- the u@@ pris@@ ing begins in the streets of te@@ hr@@ an .
it can &apos;t afford to dou@@ bt the person who ten@@ ds the child .
one person w@@ ins .
i will come to it later .
you cannot comm@@ and compassion unless you become limit@@ less , and nobody can become limit@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
you act com@@ passion@@ ately .
if this does not b@@ low your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let &apos;s pause here .
it &apos;s good for motiv@@ ated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of home@@ work , home@@ work , lec@@ ture , home@@ work , lec@@ ture , and then you have a s@@ nap@@ shot ex@@ am .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rock@@ star team doing the software .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jum@@ ping around and not foc@@ using on one top@@ ic . &quot;
but there are also hallu@@ cin@@ ations as well , and hallu@@ cin@@ ations are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down sta@@ irs .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating vision or blin@@ dness .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ ie@@ f in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and he turned around . and then he divi@@ ded into six fig@@ ures in stri@@ ped shir@@ ts , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
when people have these simple ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal hallu@@ cin@@ ations , the primary visual cortex is activ@@ ated .
it is only if one is visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or blind that the process is inter@@ rup@@ ted .
and actually i &apos;m a little visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red myself .
but i would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate to the task .
it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable .
this looks like something out of a dr. se@@ uss book -- just all man@@ ner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called e@@ ye@@ -@@ in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electr@@ onic j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : the weird , wonderful world of bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence
the yel@@ low-@@ green area is the flu@@ ids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also anti@@ bodies , sug@@ ars , hor@@ mon@@ es , that kind of thing .
it &apos;s an accu@@ rate repres@@ entation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the cor@@ rect speed for what is oc@@ curr@@ ing inside you .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- iden@@ tical cop@@ ies of dna .
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromo@@ some is cor@@ rec@@ tly posi@@ tioned .
humanity is now fully into the tech@@ no@@ -@@ scientific age .
during 4@@ 1 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sa@@ dly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ requi@@ red cour@@ ses in science because they were afraid of failure .
ju@@ dge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what &apos;s the role of dark matter in the expan@@ sion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 10,000 years of sett@@ led agri@@ cultural civilization in small family groups . no@@ ma@@ di@@ c h@@ unter@@ s bring down rab@@ bits , gather@@ ing food .
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ ther@@ ing and le@@ ap@@ ing off the des@@ k@@ tops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant propor@@ tion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super@@ computers lin@@ ked at spee@@ ds greater than what we consider to be broad@@ band today .
he used the example of a common gra@@ zing area in which each person by simply ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing their own flo@@ ck led to over@@ gra@@ zing and the de@@ ple@@ tion of the resource .
to@@ y@@ ota , instead of tre@@ ating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a market@@ place , tre@@ ats them as a network and tra@@ ins them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competi@@ tors .
what forms of suffering could be alle@@ vi@@ ated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about co@@ operation ?
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at fli@@ ck@@ r .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
bla@@ ise ag@@ ü@@ era y arc@@ as : aug@@ ment@@ e@@ d-@@ reality maps
this was in prepar@@ ation for a mer@@ ger and ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion .
and if you remember the story about s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us was pun@@ ished by the go@@ ds to push the same rock up a h@@ ill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
what happened ?
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mix@@ ing it .
at the top of the she@@ et , we had little diagra@@ ms of how do you fold origami .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
and we &apos;re actually cam@@ bo@@ di@@ ans .
this is a picture of what pur@@ sat looks like .
but for us it meant freedom .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
so the key here is empathy .
we re@@ vis@@ ed the mental health compon@@ ent of the primary health care services by ad@@ ding psycho@@ -@@ social care and psycho@@ -@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ors to the system .
when jun@@ gi@@ an analy@@ st inge miss@@ ma@@ hl vis@@ ited afghanistan , she saw the inner wo@@ unds of war -- wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad des@@ pair , trau@@ ma and depression . and yet , in this coun@@ ty of 30 million people , there were only two do@@ zen psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . miss@@ ma@@ hl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psycho@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ing , pro@@ mot@@ ing both individual and , perhaps , national heal@@ ing .
that &apos;s true of european bio@@ fu@@ els .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capit@@ a consumption , 200 or 300 light bul@@ bs per person , and very low population den@@ si@@ ties .
wind power produ@@ ces a bit more , 2.@@ 5 wat@@ ts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.@@ 25 wat@@ ts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind far@@ ms , you need wind far@@ ms half the area of the u.@@ k .
but the same goes for rene@@ w@@ ables as well .
next , there &apos;s the he@@ ating le@@ ver .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bul@@ bs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 1@@ 25 light bul@@ bs &apos; worth .
he mentioned four great world orche@@ str@@ as , and the fif@@ th one was ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela &apos;s you@@ th sym@@ ph@@ ony orche@@ str@@ a .

from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers matter .
that actually occur@@ red this year . she took early reti@@ re@@ ment .
we are obs@@ essed with this way of thinking .
classi@@ c . hi@@ p fra@@ c@@ ture often leads to institu@@ tion@@ alization of a sen@@ ior .
these disco@@ ver@@ ies of behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers , and behavi@@ oral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscop@@ e because of our colle@@ cting data stre@@ ams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
it &apos;s achie@@ vable . we should do it econom@@ ically , we should do it mor@@ ally , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 3@@ 0,000 new infe@@ cted web@@ sites .
this is the market leader in mal@@ ware distribution , the black hole explo@@ it pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal@@ ware distribution in the last couple of quar@@ ters .
so this is writing out the mali@@ cious code , and a few seconds later , on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you &apos;ll see the attac@@ ker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
what &apos;s really insu@@ l@@ ting about this is not only does it provide the attac@@ kers with access to your data , but when the scan fin@@ ish@@ es , they tell you in order to clean up the fa@@ ke viruses , you have to regi@@ ster the product .
a little more se@@ arch@@ ing , and here &apos;s our cyber@@ crimin@@ al .
okay ? so you can see a list of wir@@ eless networks .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing rate , and that 25@@ 0,000 pieces of mal@@ ware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&quot; you can call it a dinosau@@ r , but look at the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor : the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor is cool . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agre@@ ed .
and quite frank@@ ly , i think if col@@ on@@ el s@@ anders was to be care@@ ful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually adverti@@ se an extra piece .
that &apos;s based on diet in@@ take sur@@ ve@@ ys , it &apos;s based on levels of o@@ bes@@ ity , it &apos;s based on a range of fac@@ tors that gives you an appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mou@@ ths .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harv@@ est because of co@@ s@@ me@@ tic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &apos;s ine@@ di@@ ble -- but because it doesn &apos;t look appe@@ aling . tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art del@@ ves into the sho@@ cking data of wa@@ sted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronom@@ ical union .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be un@@ fair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridi@@ cul@@ ous names .
&quot; listen , i &apos;m going back to the s@@ w@@ amp mer@@ ma@@ id . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
blue che@@ ese , ran@@ ch , oil and v@@ ine@@ gar , thousand is@@ lands and house .
now this is is@@ a@@ a@@ c from a viet@@ nam@@ ese stam@@ p .
he &apos;s all mur@@ ky . there is little kids le@@ an@@ ing on his leg , little g@@ ho@@ sts flying around . we got@@ ta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentle@@ men .
prime numbers , g@@ aus@@ s , one of my favor@@ ites .
every top ad@@ ds up to 3@@ 7 .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sex@@ y and elegan@@ t , it &apos;s hidden .
thank you .
it was incredibly successful .
it thought of itself as being dis@@ connected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle a us@@ b drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , in that case , to actually destro@@ y themselves .
and so if you hear an exper@@ t talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skep@@ tic@@ ism that you might treat the comm@@ ents of an econom@@ ist about the economy or a wea@@ ther@@ man about the weather , or something like that .
good after@@ noon .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cy@@ ber weapons .
today we &apos;re moving to a multi@@ pol@@ ar world in which co@@ ordin@@ ation is much more complicated , as we have seen at cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
of course , sea cu@@ cum@@ bers sho@@ ot them out their re@@ ars , which , in my opini@@ on , makes them much more interesting a super@@ hero .
and he does manage to find them , but great navi@@ gation skills , l@@ ous@@ y pi@@ ck@@ -up lines .
i couldn &apos;t fit them in .
s@@ her@@ man &apos;s up in shark hea@@ ven .
and you &apos;re getting all kinds of cool stuff .
in the lower 4@@ 8 , the far@@ th@@ est you can get away from a main@@ tain@@ ed road is 20 miles .
the ta@@ hl@@ tan have called for the creation of a tri@@ b@@ al her@@ it@@ age reser@@ ve which will set asi@@ de the largest prote@@ cted area in british colum@@ bia .
multi@@ p@@ ly 22 times 4@@ 7 , make sure you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working . do all of you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ? 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ?
5@@ 29 .
7@@ 22 is 500 -- o@@ oh , that &apos;s a harder one .
in the mean@@ while , let me conclu@@ de the first part of my show by doing something a little tri@@ ck@@ ier .
ok , any six of them .
audience : febru@@ ary .
what year , chris , would you like ?
audience : six . six .
now , 5@@ 7 times 6@@ 8 is 3@@ ,@@ 400 , plus 4@@ 7@@ 6 is 3@@ 8@@ 7@@ 6 , that &apos;s 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 , 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 is 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 9@@ 3@@ 1 .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ cian .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
had colle@@ cted photographs of me , as mothers will do .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ ine wave , almost a tri@@ ang@@ ular wave upon this he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ pac@@ k@@ ard o@@ sc@@ il@@ lo@@ scop@@ e .
but you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
now , so i know the frequ@@ ency .
i &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ pus .
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
secon@@ dly , our new man@@ tra : small is sex@@ y .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
that fix@@ ed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and ends up with a me@@ al -- changes .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the jo@@ y@@ ful emergen@@ ce of this earli@@ est of play scen@@ es and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a hand@@ le on .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an an@@ atom@@ ically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
they &apos;d given me a large gr@@ ant when i was an acade@@ mi@@ cian for the study of fel@@ ony dr@@ un@@ ken dri@@ vers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no fli@@ r@@ tation , no movies , no games , no fan@@ t@@ asy and , and , and .
found that when he looked at a play@@ ground out of a window into which he had been con@@ fin@@ ed , he felt something different .
characteri@@ zed by a feeling of energi@@ zed focus , full invol@@ vement and success in the process of the activity .
and its hu@@ gely important in learning and cra@@ f@@ ting the brain .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform fla@@ vor@@ s that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a car@@ rot ca@@ ke , put it in a bl@@ ender , and we have kind of like a car@@ rot ca@@ ke ju@@ ice , and then that went into a ballo@@ on fro@@ zen in liquid ni@@ tro@@ gen to create this hol@@ low sh@@ ell of car@@ rot ca@@ ke ice cre@@ am , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s flo@@ ating around your pla@@ te .
h@@ c : so , after about a day of chris and i star@@ ing at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the ham@@ bur@@ ger pat@@ ty , and as you can see it basically forms like ham@@ bur@@ ger meat .
h@@ c : so this is where we step into the future and we le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g ahead .
so , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
where &apos;s art ? i got produ@@ c@@ tivity . i got spor@@ ts .
and one of them is called ta@@ ket@@ a . which is which ?
the full videos are online if you are interested .
but if i come up really close and st@@ are directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice cris@@ p eyes .
i &apos;d like to show you thing called s@@ n@@ out , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s contin@@ ually surprised to see you .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 198@@ 4 to be able to discover this virus ?
deep in a remote region of c@@ amer@@ o@@ on , two h@@ unter@@ s stal@@ k their pre@@ y .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv enter@@ ed into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
paul worked for years on the c@@ amer@@ o@@ oni@@ an national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health cor@@ respon@@ dent .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retro@@ virus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
and because of that announ@@ c@@ ement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of that company -- whereas i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and raising a round of vent@@ ure capital and ra@@ mp@@ ing up hir@@ ing .
and they &apos;re t@@ we@@ eting , in some cases , from behind clo@@ se@@ d-@@ door s@@ essi@@ ons with the president .
people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasi@@ ons .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
my mother was an admini@@ str@@ ator .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consci@@ ously identify as african .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was ten@@ se , and there were deb@@ ates going on about im@@ migra@@ tion .
when i learned , some years ago , that wri@@ ters were expected to have had really un@@ happy child@@ ho@@ ods to be successful , i began to think about how i could inv@@ ent horri@@ ble things my parents had done to me .
now , the conven@@ tional wisdom was that nigeri@@ ans don &apos;t read liter@@ ature .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of par@@ ad@@ ise was re@@ ga@@ ined . &quot;
it literally fl@@ at@@ -@@ lin@@ ed .
well for the sa@@ ke of time , i want to focus on just three strategi@@ es .
we need to fundament@@ ally re@@ define who it is that experts are .
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m prepar@@ ing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
would they give me char@@ ts and graph@@ s that i could color ?
al@@ an@@ na sha@@ i@@ k@@ h : how i &apos;m prepar@@ ing to get alzheimer &apos;s
the network has two components in them .
the battery is not the gas t@@ ank , in a sense .
and these pri@@ ces are actually with clean electr@@ ons .
and i had to qu@@ it and come and do this thing called a better place .
as we star@@ ed sc@@ aling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down .
now where is the car industry on that ?
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
we have to make the right moral decision .
they see us as ro@@ cking the boat , and you can understand why .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by post@@ ul@@ ating an ag@@ ent that is even more complex , there@@ by simply com@@ po@@ unding the problem .
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journ@@ al , the quar@@ ter@@ ly re@@ view of biology .
and however we define athei@@ s@@ m , it &apos;s sur@@ ely the kind of acade@@ mic belief that a person is enti@@ t@@ led to hold without being vili@@ fied as an un@@ patri@@ o@@ tic , un@@ elec@@ table non-@@ citi@@ zen .
in 199@@ 8 , lar@@ son and with@@ am po@@ ll@@ ed the cre@@ am of american scientists , those who &apos;d been hon@@ or@@ ed by ele@@ ction to the national acade@@ my of sci@@ ences , and among this sele@@ ct group , belief in a personal god dro@@ pped to a sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing seven percent .
darwin said , &quot; i have never been an athei@@ st in the same sense of den@@ ying the existence of a god .
non@@ eth@@ eless , if we want to attra@@ ct deep down athei@@ sts to come out publi@@ c@@ ly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick on our ban@@ ner than &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y &quot; or &quot; tea@@ po@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &quot;
we need an anti-@@ temp@@ le@@ ton to step forward .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capit@@ alized . not that it &apos;s become less capital inten@@ sive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s requi@@ red -- but that the ow@@ ner@@ ship of this capital , the way the capit@@ alization happens , is radi@@ cally distribu@@ ted . each of us , in these advanced econom@@ ies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- van@@ ity , pleasure -- produced links , and ti@@ ed to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
but -- and this is the dark lin@@ ing -- it is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by -- in the same way that it thre@@ at@@ ens -- the in@@ cum@@ b@@ ent industrial systems .
due to some sli@@ p-@@ u@@ ps , he managed to es@@ cape d@@ ressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our const@@ it@@ ution , those in office as gover@@ nor@@ s , president -- as in many countries -- have imm@@ unity and cannot be pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted . but what happened : people were so ou@@ tra@@ ged by this behavior that it was possible for his state leg@@ is@@ l@@ ature to im@@ pe@@ ach him and get him out of office .
we are gr@@ ate@@ ful , but we know that we can take charge of our own dest@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to re@@ form .
and in the three years that i was fin@@ ance minister , they made an average of 3@@ 60 million dollars profit per year .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diver@@ si@@ fy -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-@@ oil .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of d@@ ung@@ are@@ es with cor@@ du@@ ro@@ ys , with african material mix@@ ed in . very creative designs , has reach@@ ed a stage where she even had an order from wal@@ -@@ m@@ art .
every year , 3@@ 6@@ ,000 people in the united states die of seas@@ onal flu .
this worked well for most pa@@ tho@@ gens , some@@ what well for cra@@ f@@ ty bu@@ gs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural imm@@ unity .
and also , what the anti@@ bodies use is a hand@@ le to essentially gra@@ b and neu@@ tr@@ alize the virus .
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids v@@ acc@@ ine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ ology to make a pre@@ ven@@ tive flu v@@ acc@@ ine .
lu@@ ck@@ ily for us , we live in an era of brea@@ th@@ taking bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal advan@@ ces .
india , mexico and others are already making experiment@@ al flu vac@@ cin@@ es , and they may be the first place we see these vac@@ cin@@ es in use .
s@@ b : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
i would also like to pay ho@@ ma@@ ge and honor to the ted fel@@ lo@@ ws jun@@ e ar@@ ung@@ a , james shi@@ k@@ wat@@ i , andre@@ w , and the other ted fel@@ lo@@ ws .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invest@@ ed here in africa ?
i bel@@ ong to an internet discussion for@@ um , an african internet discussion for@@ um , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 20@@ 4 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
that &apos;s not wealth creation . it &apos;s wealth re@@ distribution .
if you look into their traditional systems , afri@@ cans organi@@ ze their states in two types .
and when they produce their cro@@ ps , they sell the sur@@ plus on market@@ places .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and land@@ ed .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
scot@@ t &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorith@@ mic fil@@ ters , these person@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introdu@@ ce us to new ideas and new people and different perspe@@ c@@ tives .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife ti@@ pp@@ er . &quot;
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature recor@@ ds in janu@@ ary .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
help with the mass per@@ su@@ asi@@ on campaign that will start this spring .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fu@@ els , have changed the atmosphere great@@ ly .
you go in along the sh@@ ore , you can find it everywhere .
so this is the gul@@ f of mexico , spar@@ kl@@ ing place full of fish .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bot@@ t@@ len@@ o@@ se dolph@@ in suddenly appe@@ ared next to the boat , and it was sp@@ lat@@ ter@@ ing oil out its blo@@ whole .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of st@@ res@@ ses and a lot of problems to begin with .
here are sh@@ ri@@ mp bo@@ ats emplo@@ yed .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial ves@@ sel in the united states -- you know , if you sp@@ ill@@ ed a couple of gall@@ ons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about nee@@ ding to make the moment out of this .
well i built a fusion re@@ actor when i was 14 years old .
ta@@ yl@@ or wil@@ son : y@@ up , i built a nuclear fusion re@@ actor
everybody : i am my connec@@ tom@@ e .
you can recognize them inst@@ antly by their fantastic shapes .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the sy@@ nap@@ ses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each sy@@ nap@@ se .
but may i ?
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neu@@ ral activity is en@@ co@@ ding our thoughts , feelings and per@@ cep@@ tions , our mental experiences .
let us attemp@@ t to read out memor@@ ies from connec@@ tom@@ es .
if you believe that i am my connec@@ tom@@ e , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connec@@ tom@@ e .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan : kei@@ th and i lead a research team .
because the way that he pres@@ ented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for s@@ ale right now .
now , i &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the mag@@ net &apos;s fall@@ ing , the greater the stopp@@ ing force .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this pres@@ entation has been brought to you by target .
while he was doing this , he noticed an un@@ expected thing .

can we produce a men@@ u that &apos;s deli@@ cious without fo@@ ie gras ?
&quot; span@@ ish che@@ f acc@@ used ... &quot; -- and the french acc@@ used him .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goo@@ se wh@@ is@@ per@@ er .
even though they were im@@ pris@@ oned in this garden of e@@ den with fi@@ gs and everything else .
his biggest ob@@ stac@@ le , really , was the market@@ place , which dem@@ ands these days bright yellow fo@@ ie gras .
and he grab@@ s my arm and the transl@@ ator &apos;s , and du@@ cks us under a bush and says , &quot; watch this . &quot;
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
but i can taste things .
i really was moved .
he ta@@ sted it and fell in love with it .
if human beings disappe@@ ared , life on earth as we know it would fl@@ our@@ ish . &quot;
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , sec@@ ure , healthy and dur@@ able .
let me say that again .
america could lead this next automo@@ tive revolution .
we can use some smart it to en@@ h@@ ance trans@@ it and en@@ able car sharing and ride sharing .
most of it now is wa@@ sted and the technologies for saving it keep impro@@ ving faster than we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing them .
well , from the coal bur@@ ned at the power plant through all these com@@ po@@ unding los@@ ses , only a tent@@ h of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pi@@ pe as flow .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts in milli@@ seconds , often for weeks or months , often without war@@ ning .
in 197@@ 6 , for example , government and industry insi@@ sted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of g@@ dp could never go down .
thank you .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a nar@@ row set of government eli@@ tes with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ulti@@ mate bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of development assi@@ stance .
in this map from mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distri@@ cts that have low spending on schools but good edu@@ cational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the opposite .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
if we take the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush -- i don &apos;t think about the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a fro@@ g ; after , we become a mon@@ key ; after , we become what we are today : a super@@ -@@ mon@@ key , and the fun is , the super@@ -@@ mon@@ key we are today , is at half of the story .
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexi@@ ble , inside yourself .
that &apos;s why we must ada@@ pt .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
no sl@@ ou@@ ching , no pants han@@ ging down , none of that stuff .
and the dri@@ ll ser@@ ge@@ ant starts scre@@ aming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother .
the last chap@@ ter in my book is called &quot; the gift of a good start . &quot;
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
you get a job and get out of the house .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
i &apos;m a marke@@ ter , and as a marke@@ ter , i know that i &apos;ve never really been in control .
h@@ ul@@ u and net@@ fli@@ x , among other companies , have open vac@@ ation poli@@ cies .
the days are past when a person , company or brand could ti@@ ghtly control their repu@@ tation -- online ch@@ at@@ ter and sp@@ in mean that if you &apos;re relevant , there &apos;s a const@@ ant , fre@@ e-@@ form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim le@@ ber@@ echt off@@ ers three big ideas about accep@@ ting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an im@@ pe@@ tus to re@@ com@@ mit to your values .
they want to make people live in fear .
but people did not rel@@ ate to this .
they were actually attac@@ king them .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
i feel that i have dig@@ ni@@ ty that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
so we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a techni@@ que that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
so babies absor@@ b the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bo@@ und listen@@ ers that we are .
whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
in investi@@ g@@ ating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to un@@ cover deep tru@@ ths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
but i have to tell you a funny story .
so what happened now is , when the water@@ color was flo@@ wing into the structure , the water@@ colors do not mix with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the wh@@ is@@ key , and that i should rather drink it .
in that ho@@ spi@@ ce , there were 3@@ 1 men and women who were ac@@ tively dying .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a sla@@ ve to take care of me .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paraly@@ zed by fear .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defen@@ ded heart .
may we actu@@ alize that capacity for women everywhere .
now , it &apos;s no surprise that when you add con@@ se@@ cu@@ tive fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i numbers , you get the next fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i number . right ?
bene@@ ath that , i &apos;ll put a two-@@ b@@ y-@@ two square , and next to that , a three-@@ b@@ y-@@ three square , bene@@ ath that , a five-@@ b@@ y-@@ five square , and then an ei@@ ght-@@ b@@ y-@@ eight square , creating one giant rec@@ tan@@ gle , right ?
now , being ir@@ ani@@ an-@@ american pres@@ ents its own set of problems , as you know .
and i started fre@@ a@@ king out , because i don &apos;t know what kind of cra@@ p my grand@@ father was into .
but what was interesting was , the paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m guy -- see he gives a bad name to musli@@ ms and middle e@@ ast@@ ern@@ ers and paki@@ stan@@ is from all over the world .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zar@@ a store . it &apos;s three miles away .
i go , &quot; he &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot;
mar@@ co temp@@ est : when asked about de@@ ception , he said this : magic is the only honest prof@@ ession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terror@@ ism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was intervie@@ wing the red bri@@ ga@@ des , i also discovered that their life was not rul@@ ed by politics or ide@@ ology , but actually was rul@@ ed by economics .
so , i decided that i wanted to investi@@ gate the economics of terror@@ ism .
but the great change came , of course , with glob@@ alization and der@@ e@@ gu@@ lation .
now , when i went to look at the fig@@ ures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the fe@@ der@@ al reser@@ ve prin@@ ts every year in order to satis@@ fy which , of course , refle@@ cts the growth of the economy .
now , the eur@@ o was a new@@ ly born cur@@ ren@@ cy of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that i &apos;m at sea , generally .
awful , really awful .
when they opened this one up , they found its sto@@ mach was full of plastic .
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s ra@@ cked with fam@@ ine and dr@@ ought .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimis@@ m .
it &apos;s too late . that is gone .
can i have the lights off for a moment ?
and so what the buil@@ der will get is every single individual part that has been cu@@ sto@@ m manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red off@@ -@@ site and deli@@ vered on a tru@@ ck to the site , to that buil@@ der , and a set of these instru@@ ction manu@@ als .

for example , in my first ted@@ talk , i did pro@@ pose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .

on the right hand side , that bit there is part of an instal@@ lation that is about 12 feet long .
by this stage the project had taken on a vi@@ ral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
the first one she did was kni@@ tting .
now mathemati@@ cians have ans@@ wer@@ ed that question .
it &apos;s a bit like this : imagine that we &apos;d only ever en@@ counter@@ ed eu@@ cli@@ de@@ an space .
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
he believed that the cr@@ y@@ st@@ al was the model for all kinds of repres@@ entation .

this is a system that &apos;s designed to save the status qu@@ o , including the status qu@@ o of big and invasi@@ ve government .

that has not happened at all in space flying .
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy .
and it will be sub-@@ or@@ b@@ ital . and the reason it has to be sub-@@ or@@ b@@ ital is , there is not solutions for ade@@ qu@@ ate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it &apos;s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they &apos;re putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of cap@@ ability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to col@@ oni@@ ze and to keep us from going extin@@ ct .

the technology revolution is opening the world .
now , what is open@@ ness ?

now , the third meaning and cor@@ respon@@ ding principle of open@@ ness is about sharing .
social media didn &apos;t create the revolution ; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn &apos;t want to be treated as subje@@ cts anymore .
people didn &apos;t know about things .
it prote@@ cts the birds .
so why should we care about blood ves@@ sel@@ s ?

in effect , when we give cancer patients anti@@ angiogen@@ ic therapy -- here , an experiment@@ al drug for a gli@@ om@@ a , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dra@@ matic changes that occu@@ r when the tumor is being star@@ ved .

the active ingre@@ dient &apos;s res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , it &apos;s also found in red wine .

the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can &apos;t take these ob@@ ese mi@@ ce and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse &apos;s weight is supposed to be .

that &apos;s his hair . you get a lot of figu@@ re-@@ ground problems .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
their stories were so horri@@ fic , and so min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horri@@ fic to think what we do to girls in the world .
i know a 14@@ -year-old girl in the ne@@ ther@@ lands , for example , who is dem@@ and@@ ing that she take a boat and go around the entire world by her@@ self .
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like , and what a mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated vagina looked like .
and when she got to the house she was gre@@ et@@ ed .
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot;
i re@@ jo@@ ice that it &apos;s still in my body .

this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
some of the teen@@ a@@ gers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
and this ble@@ w his mind . literally . he che@@ cked into a san@@ it@@ ari@@ um .
so nature has this self-@@ similar structure .
well , i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at .
first of all , i agree with mu@@ di@@ m@@ be &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; the invention of africa , &quot; that africa is an artificial invention of first col@@ oni@@ alism , and then op@@ posi@@ tional mov@@ ements .
here &apos;s a wonderful fra@@ c@@ tal .
and one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you out here . &quot;
so let me end with just a few words about appli@@ cations that we &apos;ve found for this .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far@@ ther than africa to find these rob@@ ust self-@@ organi@@ zing algorith@@ ms .
at 7 p@@ .@@ m@@ . on a sun@@ day in hidden spr@@ ings , i@@ da@@ h@@ o , where the six members of the star@@ r family are sitting down to the high@@ light of their week : the family meeting .
he read 30 years of harvard business re@@ view before st@@ um@@ bling upon an article in 198@@ 6 called &quot; the new new product development game . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t under@@ esti@@ mate the power of doing this . &quot;
it felt like we were kind of la@@ ying these under@@ ground c@@ ables that wouldn &apos;t light up their world for many years to come .
we &apos;ll have family break@@ fast . we &apos;ll meet for a bed@@ time s@@ n@@ ack .
so we said , &quot; okay , give us a reward and give us a pun@@ ish@@ ment . okay ? &quot;
jim coll@@ ins , the auth@@ or of &quot; good to great , &quot; told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preser@@ ve the core , they stimu@@ late progress .
researchers at e@@ mor@@ y gave children a simple &quot; what do you know &quot; test .
that story perfectly cap@@ tures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
a wind@@ shi@@ el@@ d co@@ ating is going to give you about 1@@ 10 degrees .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with one last demon@@ stration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
and that was that she did two entire shows pro@@ mot@@ ing that movie &quot; the secret . &quot;
when a word was mentioned , an image of it inst@@ antly appe@@ ared in his mind .
a world tele@@ graph@@ y center -- imagine news , mes@@ sages , sounds , images deli@@ vered to any point in the world inst@@ antly and wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly .
it &apos;s been around for about 7@@ ,000 years .
again , we are making holes in the sk@@ ul@@ l about the size of a di@@ me , putting an electro@@ de in , and then this electro@@ de is completely underneath the skin down to a pac@@ e@@ maker in the ch@@ est , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can ad@@ just how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain .
so here he is .
so we went ahead and implan@@ ted electro@@ des in patients with depression .
and indeed , at the top , you &apos;ll see before the surgery , the areas in blue are the areas that use less gl@@ u@@ co@@ se than normal , pre@@ domin@@ antly the par@@ ie@@ tal and tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes .
i get to do this all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible .
and they can be mod@@ el@@ ed by a spr@@ ing-@@ mass system that we call the spring mass system because we &apos;re bi@@ ome@@ chan@@ ists . it &apos;s actually a po@@ go stick .
this is a collaboration we have with stanford .
we couldn &apos;t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , spr@@ ing@@ y legs , you could make it as man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able as any that &apos;s ever been built .
like if we had a piece of ta@@ pe now , we &apos;d pe@@ el it this way .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re limited to , at the moment .
and just recently we &apos;ve made a break@@ through , where we now believe we &apos;re going to be able to create the first syn@@ thetic , self-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing , dry ad@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve . many companies are interested in this .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
i don &apos;t have the right answer .
he re@@ ads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lec@@ tures , mar@@ ches himself up to our room a couple days before the ex@@ am to get himself tu@@ tor@@ ed .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
and she said , &quot; i learned something today .
message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
they &apos;re just not moving .
when people don &apos;t take their p@@ ills , when people don &apos;t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems .
they would get dent@@ ures , and if you got dent@@ ures , you weren &apos;t going to be able to eat cor@@ n-@@ on-@@ the-@@ co@@ b , you &apos;ll eat mus@@ h for the rest of your life .
this is still the way we &apos;re communic@@ ating mes@@ sages about health .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dar@@ t@@ mouth medical school , li@@ sa schwar@@ tz and steven w@@ olo@@ sh@@ in .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
but we &apos;re not using it . it &apos;s just sitting there .
i want to say a word for nature because we haven &apos;t talked that much about it the last couple days .
the be@@ e is not calling the sh@@ ots .
u@@ gh . mini@@ -@@ me .
now , the other use of this is practical .
he wa@@ its three days , and then we to@@ wed in something called the eg@@ g@@ mobile .
and the species in the soil go to work basically che@@ wing through those roots , de@@ com@@ pos@@ ing them -- the earth@@ wor@@ ms , the f@@ ung@@ i , the bacteria -- and the result is new soil .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
and if you &apos;re happy with that , fantastic .
so the first one -- the most famous ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
you should get points for doing this on time .
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
and we &apos;ve introduced a pro@@ gr@@ ession dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by eng@@ aging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually un@@ lock re@@ wards .
this next decade is the decade of games .
so you can see : here we are in the u.s. , and they &apos;re all coming up red .
and if we can switch to sli@@ des -- all right , here we go .
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , se@@ arch@@ -@@ wise , it &apos;s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &apos;s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
fro@@ og@@ le lets you search sh@@ opp@@ ing information , and blog@@ ger lets you publi@@ sh things .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads .
so , &quot; related sear@@ ches , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this fe@@ ature into our ad@@ sense ads , called &quot; related sear@@ ches . &quot;
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hi@@ red to do , something like 25 years ago .
and to do that meant creating the fl@@ at@@ test gra@@ di@@ ents that had ever yet been made , which meant building long vi@@ a@@ du@@ cts across river val@@ le@@ ys -- this is actually the vi@@ a@@ du@@ ct across the th@@ ames at ma@@ iden@@ head -- and long tun@@ n@@ els such as the one at box , in wil@@ ts@@ hi@@ re .
what makes technology useful and us@@ able ?
and instead of inst@@ all@@ ing the lar@@ ge-@@ scale machines used by western produ@@ cers , they used low-@@ cost c@@ ad / c@@ am prototyp@@ ing technology .
now the industrial systems of br@@ un@@ el &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
in response , he gave me an even more cour@@ te@@ ous version of the same explan@@ ation .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sti@@ cking to their g@@ uns , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what other people want or re@@ com@@ men@@ d .
the assu@@ mption then that we do best when the individual self choo@@ ses only hol@@ ds when that self is clearly divi@@ ded from others .
of course , you and i know that co@@ ke is the better choice .
it &apos;s not a mar@@ ker of liber@@ ation , but of suff@@ oc@@ ation by meaning@@ less min@@ u@@ ti@@ a@@ e .
in fr@@ ance , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be re@@ moved , while in the united states , the final decision re@@ sted with the parents .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn &apos;t always work out that way .
and so one time i was in a beauty sal@@ on , and i was trying to decide between two very light sha@@ des of p@@ ink .
she@@ en@@ a i@@ y@@ en@@ gar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . at ted@@ global , she talks about both tri@@ vi@@ al choices and profound ones , and shares her gro@@ und@@ breaking research that has un@@ covered some surprising at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des about our decisions .
then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front ru@@ d@@ der here .
so i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage prote@@ i number eight . it &apos;s not the last one , but it &apos;s a good one for making demo@@ s .
this is a proud member of prote@@ i from korea , and on the right side , this is a multi@@ ple@@ -@@ ma@@ sts design pro@@ posed by a team in mexico .
when sen@@ ior fellow c@@ es@@ ar har@@ ada heard about the de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing effects of the b@@ p oil sp@@ ill in the gul@@ f of mexico in 2010 , he qu@@ it his dream job and moved to new or@@ le@@ ans to develop a more efficient way to so@@ ak up the oil . he designed a highly man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able , flexi@@ ble boat capable of cle@@ an@@ ing large tra@@ cts quickly . but rather than turn a profit , he has op@@ ted to open-@@ source the design .
ph : there &apos;s been an un@@ easy relationship between the tv business and the tech business , really ever since they both turned about 30 .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accoun@@ ting and arti@@ ll@@ ery mor@@ ph into media ?
enter the atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
and then , the 9@@ 2 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and ru@@ b it out from the center to the cor@@ ners , like this .
if you sub@@ stit@@ ute the word blo@@ go@@ sphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
and into that fer@@ ment came the micro@@ process@@ or .
this method allows you to use exi@@ sting video@@ dis@@ c materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
in 193@@ 9 , the radio corpo@@ ration of america introduced television .
it &apos;s a custom@@ er , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s partici@@ p@@ ating .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
and so every time a new medium arri@@ ves , the old medium is the content , and it is highly obser@@ vable , highly notic@@ e@@ able , but the real , real rough@@ ing up and mas@@ sa@@ ging is done by the new medium , and it is ignor@@ ed .
i was walking around on the streets of am@@ ster@@ dam and i recogni@@ zed , you know , the big story from am@@ ster@@ dam isn &apos;t what &apos;s in the design stor@@ es , it &apos;s what &apos;s out on the streets , and maybe it &apos;s self-@@ explan@@ atory , but a city that hasn &apos;t been taken over by moder@@ nis@@ m , that &apos;s preser@@ ved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bi@@ cycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an rights are prote@@ cted .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it star@@ es back at you the way that a figure might .
the du@@ tch are good also , but the itali@@ ans are good .
and i do think pattern has the cap@@ ability of er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a stat@@ ement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the ag@@ gressi@@ ve nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large mas@@ ses of things , and when you -- in mon@@ o@@ culture , and i think the preser@@ vation of diversity in culture is something that &apos;s important to us .
ro@@ b for@@ bes , the fo@@ under of design within reach , shows a g@@ aller@@ y of s@@ nap@@ sh@@ ots that in@@ form his way of seeing the world . char@@ ming ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tions , found art , urban patterns -- this sli@@ des@@ how will open your eyes to the world around you .
so i built model air@@ planes .
and for the following 25 years , living in it@@ al@@ y , living in america , i dol@@ ed out a piece of this roman@@ ce to anybody who &apos;d pay for it -- this sense , this a@@ es@@ thetic feeling , for the experience revol@@ ving around a designed object .
and that &apos;s the way i work now .

i found myself in a hospital in an intensi@@ ve-@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emergen@@ cy surgery .
so , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , &quot; where have you lived ? &quot;
and all of those black dots are all of the tox@@ ic rele@@ ase inv@@ ent@@ ories that are monit@@ or@@ ed by the ep@@ a .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . &quot;
i &apos;m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue al@@ ga@@ e problem ?
cell mem@@ bran@@ es are phosp@@ hor@@ us-@@ based : these are called phosp@@ ho@@ li@@ pi@@ ds .
you &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wa@@ ste@@ ful .
what are we to do ? we are fac@@ ed with a parado@@ x .
and over time , this mush@@ room has evolved and adap@@ ted to se@@ ek out even the tin@@ i@@ est tra@@ ce of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za was used in one field but not in the other .
so , examples like christ@@ op@@ her wr@@ en &apos;s king &apos;s cross : you can see that the struc@@ tural forces of the v@@ au@@ l@@ ting get artic@@ ul@@ ated as lines , so you &apos;re really actually seeing the expression of struc@@ tural force and form .
now , typically you &apos;d think that they would all be the same : like , the cha@@ irs you &apos;re sitting in would all be the same dimension .
and here we &apos;ve broken the 500 a@@ part@@ ments up into small neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , and differ@@ enti@@ ated those neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible vari@@ ation in the components .
finally , i &apos;d like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabri@@ cation .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an edge of the ama@@ zon , here also in 197@@ 5 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &apos;s a l@@ one farmer out there in the middle of the pri@@ me@@ val jung@@ le .
well , the color@@ a@@ do on a typical day in the 195@@ 0s , this is just , you know , not a flo@@ od , not a dr@@ ought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
let &apos;s put it that way .
and yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much .
the green areas here show where cor@@ n y@@ i@@ el@@ ds , just showing cor@@ n as an example , are already really high , probably the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the y@@ i@@ el@@ d you should be able to get .
we need to face &apos; the other in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth . &apos; a global crisis in agriculture .
and there &apos;s nothing we do that is more cru@@ cial to our survival .
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the la@@ go@@ on somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an a@@ ster@@ is@@ k , and the a@@ ster@@ is@@ k is that it ex@@ clu@@ des two thir@@ ds of the workers of the world .
they &apos;re going to ed@@ dy in la@@ gos .
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a co@@ oper@@ ative , and this is a thought from the brazi@@ li@@ an legal sch@@ ol@@ ar ro@@ ber@@ to man@@ gab@@ ei@@ ra unger .
there are also some children who are born without arms , called con@@ gen@@ ital lim@@ b de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ency .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
imagine , with somebody who &apos;s lost their whole arm , we still have four major ner@@ ves that go down your arm .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their ch@@ est go like this .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
ak : so i have the el@@ bo@@ w that goes up and down .
here &apos;s am@@ anda using an arm made by de@@ ka research corpo@@ ration .
but look at all the electro@@ des around it .
to@@ d@@ d ku@@ i@@ ken : a pro@@ s@@ thetic arm that &quot; feels &quot;
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to condu@@ ct due to wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad poverty , en@@ de@@ mic diseases and in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate health care systems .
public accoun@@ t@@ ability needs to be pro@@ mot@@ ed through transpar@@ ency and independent re@@ view by non@@ govern@@ mental and international organizations as appropriate .
now , there are around a thousand tru@@ cks and bus@@ es and cars there .
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-@@ d@@ ressed .
where it &apos;s blue and it &apos;s green , it means the water is really cold .
and so we have this pengu@@ in project . the wild@@ life conser@@ vation society has fund@@ ed me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
because we &apos;ve solved the problem in ch@@ u@@ but pro@@ vin@@ ce , which is like a state in ar@@ gent@@ ina where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is -- so that &apos;s about 1,000 kilometers of co@@ ast@@ line -- but we haven &apos;t solved the problem in northern ar@@ gent@@ ina , ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay and brazil .
tur@@ bo &apos;s never been f@@ ed .
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hur@@ ry . she &apos;s got food .
for them , nations , countries , boundar@@ ies , bor@@ ders still matter a great deal , and often viol@@ ently .
as you can see on this map , russi@@ a is still the largest country in the world .
they set up their own ba@@ za@@ ars and medical clin@@ ics .
specifically , it tar@@ gets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong al@@ lies of the united states .
so what can we do to think about bor@@ ders differently in this part of the world ?
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
and i as@@ sure you it &apos;s every bit as important to them as it might have been to col@@ oni@@ z@@ ers and im@@ peri@@ alists .
in 2004 , 15 new countries jo@@ ined the e@@ .@@ u .
the post-@@ col@@ oni@@ al entrop@@ y that is happening around the world is acceler@@ ating , and i expect more such changes to occu@@ r in the map as the states frag@@ ment .
many people think the lines on the map no longer matter , but para@@ g k@@ han@@ na says they do . using maps of the past and present , he explains the ro@@ ot causes of bor@@ der confli@@ cts worldwide and pro@@ pos@@ es simple yet c@@ un@@ ning solutions for each .
and next you &apos;re going to see the long-@@ lived mu@@ t@@ ant when it &apos;s young .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . and you would never know .
now you &apos;ve all heard of at least insu@@ lin .
so it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
that &apos;s how it works . that &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long li@@ fes@@ pan , until we have the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant .
and that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from scrat@@ ch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resi@@ stant to a lot of different environmental st@@ res@@ ses like high temperature or hydro@@ gen per@@ o@@ xide , things like that .
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
here &apos;s another good article about a new campaign op@@ pos@@ ing pri@@ va@@ ti@@ zation of trans@@ it without any contact information for the campaign .
which leads us to the last one , which is our elec@@ tions .
i can see i &apos;ve got my work cut out for me here .
now to begin to over@@ come our ignor@@ ance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circu@@ it@@ ry , it &apos;s hel@@ p@@ ful to work on what we bi@@ ologists call &quot; model organisms , &quot; animals like fru@@ it flies and laboratory mi@@ ce , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecul@@ arly identify and pin@@ point specific clas@@ ses of neurons , as you heard about in all@@ an j@@ ones &apos;s talk this morning .
val@@ ence means good or bad , positive or negative .
you can train a fly to avoid an od@@ or , shown here in blue , if you pair that od@@ or with a sho@@ ck .
modern psychiat@@ ric drugs treat the chemistry of the whole brain , but neuro@@ biolog@@ ist david ander@@ son belie@@ ves in a more nu@@ an@@ ced view of how the brain fun@@ ctions . he ill@@ umin@@ ates new research that could lead to tar@@ ge@@ ted psychiat@@ ric medi@@ cations -- that work better and avoid side effects . how &apos;s he doing it ? for a start , by making a bunch of fru@@ it flies an@@ gry .
so we set up an experiment where@@ by we put a na@@ ked volunte@@ er in a large c@@ age , and in that c@@ age we rele@@ ased mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os to see where they were bit@@ ing on the body of that person .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these po@@ ols of water with the lar@@ va@@ e , they are sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ed all over the place , which makes it very hard for an in@@ spec@@ tor like this to actually find all these bre@@ eding sites and treat them with inse@@ c@@ ti@@ ci@@ des .
here we go .
but not all patients on the transp@@ l@@ ant wait list are so fortun@@ ate .
and in my mind , i realized as a sur@@ gical pi@@ one@@ er that the purpose of my position of influence was sur@@ ely to speak up for those who have no influence .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the lab@@ s are ra@@ cing to conver@@ t aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are ra@@ cing to re@@ program these cells back into more useful i@@ ps cells .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth fac@@ tors to re@@ pair dama@@ ged heart muscle or be differ@@ enti@@ ated into heart muscle cells to re@@ store heart function .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela .
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
yeah .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encoura@@ ge you to do the same .
but we don &apos;t know where , since we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern .
first , it &apos;s clearly a non-@@ invasi@@ ve , wir@@ eless form of communication .
you &apos;re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that fru@@ strate you when you try to s@@ w@@ at the fly .
whenever a fly reach@@ es the mid@@ point of the cham@@ ber where the two od@@ or stre@@ ams meet , it has to make a decision .
whenever it comes up to the mid@@ point , it p@@ aus@@ es , it carefully sc@@ ans the od@@ or interface as if it was s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing out its environment , and then it turns around .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much rema@@ ins to be discovered .
and it &apos;s depen@@ dent on passi@@ ve patients who just take it and don &apos;t ask any questions .
thomas bat@@ u@@ ik : hi there , eric .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. ba@@ ti@@ u@@ k .
i had my own heart sc@@ are years ago in graduate school , when we &apos;re under treatment for the kid@@ ney , and suddenly , they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot;
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of mira@@ cle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is tre@@ ating us as a@@ ver@@ ages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the gu@@ ess@@ work .
so &quot; thank you &quot; feel li@@ kes a really tri@@ te word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
that &apos;s k@@ ell@@ ar au@@ tu@@ m@@ n , my former ph@@ .@@ d. student , professor now at le@@ wi@@ s and c@@ lar@@ k , literally giving his fir@@ st-@@ born child up for this test .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at sti@@ ck@@ y@@ bot .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from na@@ than , we &apos;ve talked about an active tail .
for those of you who remember your physics , that &apos;s a zer@@ o-@@ ang@@ ul@@ ar-@@ moment@@ um ri@@ gh@@ ting response . but it &apos;s like a c@@ at .
so we can man@@ eu@@ ver this way .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the clo@@ se@@ -up . and see if you can see it land .
so i will spend a little time at the end .
well , the problem is that we &apos;ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
this was -- this is south of the ant@@ arc@@ tic circle .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
we &apos;ve actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
so i &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean aci@@ di@@ fication .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this che@@ mo@@ stat@@ ted ocean , that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or ada@@ pt to this ra@@ pid aci@@ di@@ fication that &apos;s going on right now .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ strate of all there is .
he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension .
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &apos;s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscop@@ ic dep@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have addi@@ tional cur@@ led up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don &apos;t see them .
this something else is this dan@@ cing fil@@ am@@ ent of energy .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
and if you watch these little fel@@ lo@@ ws vi@@ br@@ ating around -- they &apos;ll be there in a second -- right there , notice that they way they vi@@ bra@@ te is affected by the geome@@ try of the extra dimensions .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , electro@@ magne@@ tis@@ m , all together in one pac@@ ka@@ ge , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , vie@@ wed through a sort of a blu@@ ish medium .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
but i &apos;m not going to change anything within those bo@@ xes , except their meaning .
move your eyes around , blin@@ k , maybe close one eye .
and they land on the flo@@ wer . they stick their ton@@ gue in there , called a pro@@ bo@@ sc@@ is , and they drink sugar water .
and you &apos;ll see there is a line , a fa@@ int line going across that image .
so , now , what i want to do : i &apos;m going to put the middle nine sur@@ faces here under yellow ill@@ um@@ ination by simply putting a filter behind them .
so if you look at security from economic terms , it &apos;s a tra@@ de-@@ off .
and i think that &apos;s a fundament@@ ally interesting question .
so you can imagine how that works .
there &apos;s no real word for stuff that makes us sec@@ ure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel sec@@ ure .
i have feeling and reality .
i was born in new york city .
intui@@ tive is just another word for familiar .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smo@@ king .
strong feelings can create a model .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at .
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
and let me show you what happened .
jo@@ ach@@ im de pos@@ ada : don &apos;t eat the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low !
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
let me show you a slide here which illu@@ str@@ ates the character of confli@@ cts since 194@@ 6 until today .
and my country reli@@ es on its security through military alli@@ ance , that &apos;s clear .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neu@@ tra@@ l to talk .
i think that is wrong .
so what can we learn from all of this ?
it &apos;s cru@@ cial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of glob@@ alization , societies from bot@@ tom@@ -up .
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s pengu@@ in sh@@ it . &quot;
and recently , i was in e@@ aster island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly myster@@ i@@ ous place , because no matter where you go in e@@ aster island , you &apos;re stru@@ ck by these stat@@ u@@ es , called the mo@@ ai .
how long have they been standing in what posi@@ tions ?
so , this device here is an invisi@@ bility clo@@ ak .
this subje@@ cts food to a force about 5@@ 0,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it cl@@ ari@@ fy chicken stock .
i mean , can you imagine ? e@@ .@@ t@@ . &apos; s ph@@ oning home , and i &apos;m not , like , there ? you know , horri@@ ble !
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x looks like in my living room .
so , there &apos;s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shou@@ ts , &quot; what &apos;s that in the water ? &quot;
having expla@@ ined those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about tre@@ ating cancer .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asi@@ an person and a european person by looking at their ingre@@ di@@ ents list .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them .
so this is the sig@@ nature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you .
so your house is dealing with lea@@ ks all the time , but it &apos;s fix@@ ing them . it &apos;s dra@@ ining them out and so on .
so thank you very much .
febru@@ ary 4@@ th , we po@@ sted it on our website . this was before super tu@@ es@@ day .
stage one is a group where people syste@@ matically se@@ ver relationships from func@@ tional tri@@ bes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
there is , in fact , another stage .
we &apos;re great ! who is not great ? england ! &quot;
one of the people we intervie@@ wed was frank j@@ ord@@ an , former ma@@ yo@@ r of san francisco . before that he was ch@@ ie@@ f of police in san francisco .
pretty much everybody else who does po@@ ll@@ s .
i &apos;m going to read a few stri@@ ps .
it &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house .
it was not until the 14@@ th century that an itali@@ an pain@@ ter recogni@@ zed the la@@ p as a gre@@ cian temp@@ le , u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster@@ ed in fl@@ es@@ h and cl@@ oth .
apri@@ co@@ t hal@@ ves like the e@@ ars of cher@@ u@@ b@@ im .
and it &apos;s too cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l to anima@@ te gu@@ ts and he@@ arts and behavior when the going gets r@@ ough .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the terri@@ tory of myster@@ y -- encoura@@ ging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stran@@ ger , in the face of the vi@@ br@@ ant religious other .
je@@ an v@@ ani@@ er says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , belo@@ ved , late friend mother ter@@ es@@ a -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it &apos;s in the first instance about changing ourselves .
but he watched physi@@ ci@@ sts and chemi@@ sts become the pur@@ ve@@ y@@ ors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .
ra@@ ch@@ el na@@ om@@ i re@@ men is a better doctor because of her life@@ -@@ long struggle with cro@@ hn &apos;s disease .
but i rec@@ ited a che@@ er . i rec@@ ited a che@@ er along with everybody else .
it &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the hel@@ m , not because they enjo@@ yed direc@@ ting others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insi@@ ghts of con@@ temporary psychology .
and they fe@@ ature as their role models really great sal@@ es@@ men .
and even away from the po@@ dium , when you called him to say hell@@ o , he would often end the conversation pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
this is especially important for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted children too .
and then i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaning@@ ful .
so , one of our passi@@ ons in our company , and now one of my personal passi@@ ons , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , acc@@ essi@@ ble and aff@@ ord@@ able .
as a matter of fact , we think reach@@ ing 100 percent is very do@@ able , even before the 20@@ 15 ti@@ me@@ frame . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good -- has been soli@@ d , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , la@@ tin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently vis@@ iting south africa .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i started it with one other family in 19@@ 80 .
and i asked this guy , i said , &quot; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
i don &apos;t own a gu@@ es@@ thou@@ se .
it &apos;s all about more , having more .
when you read this pra@@ yer , it sounds incredibly sel@@ fish , self-@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed .
now , they &apos;re 13 miles up the road in s@@ ant@@ a ana .
but he doesn &apos;t do mira@@ cles just to show off .
last year , i was invited to speak at n@@ ba all@@ -@@ stars game .
if you &apos;re wired to make de@@ als , you make de@@ als .
and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and somewhere in the middle of south da@@ k@@ ota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative lea@@ p you can make .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the surge@@ on has per@@ formed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
the mira@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and complexity and myster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i don &apos;t know .
one of the ir@@ on@@ ies of this whole system is we &apos;re discus@@ sing what to do about a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &apos;s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assu@@ mption , and one of the best gu@@ esses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absor@@ b sun@@ light , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black ri@@ vers .
what is this ? this is the first transp@@ l@@ ant of na@@ ked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , ins@@ ert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that &apos;s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
i happened to buy that mot@@ el about three months after vi@@ vi@@ an started working there .
but given my be@@ fu@@ dd@@ led state of mind , i ended up in the self-@@ help section very quickly .
they didn &apos;t even see the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff higher up the pyrami@@ d .
so as i spent time with leaders in the g@@ n@@ h movement , i got to really understand what they &apos;re doing .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dic@@ tion@@ ary , many dic@@ tion@@ aries define pur@@ suit as to &quot; ch@@ ase with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty . &quot;
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simpli@@ city .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
b@@ l : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re moving . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the boat , say i &apos;m standing still .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
b@@ l : &quot; can you help me , henry ? &quot; what good scientist says that , right ?
so we asked lar@@ ry and nat@@ al@@ ie he@@ m@@ pel to write a comm@@ ent@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to biology letters .
b@@ l : this is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . right . okay .
this is terrible , this oil -- it &apos;s in the water .
we feel so good about ourselves .
bi@@ om@@ i@@ mi@@ c@@ ry , which is something that is an emerging science , win@@ ds up being a very important social justice idea .
california has one of the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates of all the 50 states .
it was a trying and sc@@ ary thing for a young kid to be going through .
it &apos;s bad enough on a high@@ way , what &apos;s it going to be like to be in the air ?
this is the world -- there won &apos;t be you as a pilot . and i know the pil@@ ots in the audience aren &apos;t going to like that -- and i &apos;ve had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there , flying around and experi@@ en@@ cing that .
wonderful engine .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
wir@@ es su@@ ck , they really do .
what dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of those trans@@ form@@ ers using this technology , which is not dis@@ similar from the way an oper@@ a sing@@ er sh@@ at@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
and then finally , electric vehi@@ cles .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
and no@@ ki@@ a as well .
so what happens to all these tox@@ ins when we die ?
we want to eat , not be e@@ aten by , our food .
thank you .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
they &apos;re ex@@ o@@ tic . they &apos;re experiment@@ al .
so what do we make of all of this ?
it &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in den@@ ial . &quot;
ho@@ spi@@ ce was for people who were dying , and ter@@ ence wasn &apos;t dying .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , in@@ sur@@ ance companies , us , started accoun@@ ting for the power of that hope .
well , we collect data from satelli@@ tes , from air@@ planes , from ground vehi@@ cles , from people .
this process is a very calcul@@ ated process .
microsoft &apos;s ste@@ phen law@@ ler gives a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper@@ -@@ real c@@ it@@ y@@ scap@@ es with da@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly flu@@ i@@ di@@ ty , a remarkable fe@@ at that requires st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing amo@@ unts of data to bring into focus .
you need also state ow@@ ner@@ ship , especially of land asse@@ ts , in order to build and roll out infra@@ structures very quickly .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
by that compar@@ ison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
this is the world development inde@@ x indi@@ c@@ ator data in the early 199@@ 0s .
these are the two pictures taken of gar@@ ment fac@@ tor@@ ies in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong pro@@ vin@@ ce and gar@@ ment fac@@ tor@@ ies in india .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the system has moved in a more liber@@ al direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
i believe that the political re@@ forms are a must for china to main@@ tain its growth .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about co@@ ffe@@ e@@ houses for the last five years , because i &apos;ve been kind of on this qu@@ est to investi@@ gate this question of where good ideas come from .
and what they noticed was they don &apos;t have a lot of d@@ v@@ rs , they don &apos;t have a lot of micro@@ waves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
and darwin kept these cop@@ i@@ ous not@@ e@@ books where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hun@@ ch .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
this shift is the most stri@@ king in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
so we &apos;re living in the age of sur@@ ging income ine@@ quality , especially at the top .
we have super@@ star bank@@ ers .
again , this is no m@@ ere hypo@@ the@@ tical .
the dy@@ stop@@ ia that wor@@ ries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses inv@@ ent google and its il@@ k and the rest of us are emplo@@ yed giving them mas@@ sages .
there &apos;s many of them up there .
one in a hundred .
and this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the d@@ wind@@ ling of capacity with increasing fra@@ il@@ ty , and fra@@ il@@ ty &apos;s an inevi@@ table part of aging , and increasing fra@@ il@@ ty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of dis@@ ability , unfortunately .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that j@@ as@@ on has illu@@ strated .
it de@@ pri@@ ves eu@@ than@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand c@@ any@@ on .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
tumor cells can travel through the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , m@@ yo@@ d acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skelet@@ al muscle cells ?
and the grandmother had never let any west@@ ern@@ ers ever see her .
and remember this picture , because i &apos;m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m 28 years old , and i live in hot@@ els , and i &apos;m not married . &quot;
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok &apos;s village , and she was gone .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friend@@ ly he was getting .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the yo@@ unger kids .
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front des@@ k and the guy at the front des@@ k said , &quot; there &apos;s no other free rooms on your floor ton@@ ight , so if you want to put the kids five flo@@ ors below you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot;
and the whole room filled with smo@@ ke in about two seconds .
and i remember , nat@@ as@@ ha didn &apos;t want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we &apos;d spent so much time barri@@ c@@ ading the room .
this is a tri@@ -@@ star , and so they let nat@@ as@@ ha actually sit in the jump seat .
gene even did a little ti@@ le work in the kitchen , which was that , &quot; once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from h@@ ills of korea to live happ@@ ily ever after in atlan@@ ta . &quot;
thank you all of you .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &apos;s start with the planets .
in fact , even back during the an@@ ci@@ ents , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagra@@ m like this .
most of these are can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depen@@ ds on the planet ?
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
can you imagine how small it is ?
let &apos;s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with syn@@ thetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas z@@ im@@ bab@@ we sky@@ rock@@ et@@ ed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequ@@ ency .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
un@@ aids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
h@@ ans ro@@ s@@ ling un@@ v@@ ei@@ ls new data visu@@ als that un@@ tan@@ gle the complex risk fac@@ tors of one of the world &apos;s de@@ ad@@ li@@ est diseases : hiv . he argu@@ es that pre@@ vent@@ ing trans@@ mis@@ sions -- not drug treat@@ ments -- is the key to en@@ ding the epidemic .
it &apos;s based on pur@@ ch@@ asing power par@@ ity .
we know that &apos;s wrong , because we condu@@ cted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geogra@@ ph@@ y ma@@ tter@@ ed more than institutions .
let &apos;s call them the kil@@ ler app@@ s .
mean@@ while , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
that &apos;s the consumer society , and it prop@@ els economic growth more than even technologi@@ cal change itself .
any society can adop@@ t these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achie@@ ved after 1@@ 500 -- only faster .
that &apos;s so true .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be car@@ ing about recently .
so what this figure shows is that spi@@ ders date back to almost 3@@ 80 million years .
these can be grou@@ ped into seven categ@@ ories .
so i &apos;ve color@@ ed in the gl@@ y@@ cin@@ es again in green , al@@ an@@ ine in red , and the ser@@ ines , the letter s , in pur@@ ple . and you can see that the top repe@@ at unit can be expla@@ ined almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repe@@ at unit has a substan@@ tial amount of pur@@ ple .
what you see here on this tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess graph is the higher the black do@@ t is on the graph , the higher the tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess .
to bor@@ row from the wri@@ t@@ ings of a spi@@ der named char@@ lot@@ te , silk is terri@@ fic .
fli@@ ck@@ r is a phot@@ o-@@ sharing service that allows people to take photos , u@@ plo@@ ad them , share them over the web and so forth .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely ten photos per photograph@@ er , is a lie .
this is the math under@@ lying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
right ? so , when institutions are told they are ob@@ stac@@ les , and that there are other ways of co@@ ordin@@ ating the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku@@ bl@@ er-@@ ross st@@ ages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a f@@ at@@ al illness : den@@ ial , an@@ ger , bar@@ ga@@ ining , accep@@ tan@@ ce .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now t@@ ying themselves into kn@@ ots , trying to figure out whether or not blog@@ gers are journ@@ alists .
it was produced by analy@@ zing their communic@@ ations patterns using a lot of these tools . and dou@@ b@@ t@@ less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attac@@ ks of last week .
so a bak@@ er , and a good bak@@ er , knows how to pull or draw forth the in@@ her@@ ent sugar tra@@ pped in the star@@ ch .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of whe@@ at , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 st@@ ages .
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distin@@ ctive stage .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text@@ books call &quot; pac@@ k@@ aging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot;
it &apos;s not only been killed , but it &apos;s been den@@ i@@ ed any potential for creating future life .
bacteria is in there , eating the same sug@@ ars , turning them into aci@@ ds .
it &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
and i &apos;m not kid@@ ding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
they &apos;re all moun@@ ted on my instru@@ ments .
it &apos;s a bunch of crazy pic@@ to@@ graphic not@@ ation .
let &apos;s watch just another clip .
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
so half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she liked the cra@@ ck@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i -- just like a baby and any other san@@ e person .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mates , but also including other ma@@ mm@@ als , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ g@@ aro@@ os and wom@@ bat@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexi@@ ble they are .
and at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those wor@@ ms into those little open mou@@ ths .
then they test that new hypo@@ thesis and so on and so forth .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
oh .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
al@@ ison g@@ op@@ nik : what do babies think ?
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simu@@ late the human body and to simu@@ late that bit of the nervous system of the brain that contro@@ ls that body .
those are then sel@@ ec@@ ted by the algorith@@ m , re@@ produced with mu@@ tation and re@@ combin@@ ations to introdu@@ ce sex as well .
now , this might look kind of tri@@ vi@@ al , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any inter@@ active or any virtual worl@@ ds .
and then , finally hits the floor .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ t@@ man and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on for the past few months .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
there &apos;s so many things we can do with this right now .
we do have one un@@ inten@@ tional dan@@ cer actually , the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the i@@ pad .
i remember we cri@@ ed prof@@ us@@ ely when the little go@@ ats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ an@@ i .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspe@@ c@@ tives at the earli@@ est stage .
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
which they do .
let &apos;s create a word process@@ or that &apos;s just a word process@@ or .
there are these &quot; wi@@ z@@ ards &quot; everywhere .
pal@@ m is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
i write the code that f@@ its the world today .
i made a fortun@@ e over at pi@@ x@@ ar .
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recogni@@ tion software , and you have to be kind of quie@@ t because the software is nervous .
dp : thank you very much .
and the dan@@ ger is that they can cause roughly what &apos;s a pan@@ de@@ mic .
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
we &apos;ll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shor@@ tly .
it &apos;s a strange place inside a nan@@ ot@@ u@@ be .
we need new anti-@@ vir@@ als and cock@@ ta@@ ils . we need new kinds of vac@@ cin@@ es .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost un@@ accep@@ table to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
i think it &apos;s time that we transi@@ tioned to a solar syste@@ m-@@ going civilization and species .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s under@@ ground .
it &apos;s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &apos;m sitting in a window seat .
in this ca@@ ve , great areas are covered by this red@@ dis@@ h material that you see here , and also these enormous cr@@ y@@ st@@ als of sel@@ en@@ ite that you can see dan@@ gling down .
in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like in@@ fl@@ at@@ able lin@@ ers that can con@@ form to the complex to@@ po@@ logi@@ cal shape on the inside of a ca@@ ve , fo@@ am@@ e@@ d-@@ in-@@ place air@@ lo@@ cks to deal with this complex to@@ po@@ log@@ y , various ways of getting brea@@ thing g@@ ases made from the in@@ trin@@ si@@ c materials of these bodies .
but when you tell someone your goal and they ac@@ knowledge it , psych@@ ologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
and so it is with archi@@ me@@ des , the great gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian .
for@@ ger@@ ies were pain@@ ted over it , and it suff@@ ered very b@@ ad@@ ly from m@@ old .
and so before we could start ima@@ ging archi@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
but as the electr@@ ons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-@@ ra@@ ys .
this was a bad idea , because phili@@ p of ma@@ ce@@ don had a son called alex@@ ander the great , and they lost the battle of cha@@ er@@ one@@ a .
because institutions at the moment con@@ fine their data with copy@@ right restri@@ ctions and that sort of thing .
how do you read a two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -year-old man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt that has been er@@ ased , cut up , written on and pain@@ ted over ? with a powerful partic@@ le acceler@@ ator , of course ! ancient books cur@@ ator willi@@ am no@@ el tells the fascinating story behind the archi@@ me@@ des pal@@ imp@@ s@@ est , a by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine pra@@ yer book contain@@ ing previ@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ un@@ known original wri@@ t@@ ings from ancient gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian archi@@ me@@ des and others .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real ko@@ be , and one of them is wol@@ f@@ gang pu@@ ck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
they did give me a tour , though .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other o@@ live o@@ ils .
and to try this -- i couldn &apos;t get a lo@@ aner , but i did go into the manhattan sho@@ w@@ room of the manufac@@ tur@@ er , to@@ to , and they have a ba@@ th@@ room off of the sho@@ w@@ room that you can use , which i used .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to r@@ attle .
it was three days , four me@@ als .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
it &apos;s from the game world of war@@ craft with more than 10 million players glob@@ ally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
now , if you take a game like war@@ craft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great bo@@ x-@@ opening effort .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
second , multiple long and shor@@ t-@@ term a@@ ims -- 5,000 pi@@ es , bor@@ ing , 15 pi@@ es , interesting .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict en@@ han@@ ced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an en@@ han@@ ced level .
let &apos;s start with business .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulner@@ abilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
and so previous studies had only focused on microscop@@ y .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
unfortunately , o@@ bes@@ ity &apos;s not only an american problem .
there &apos;s this large , con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated far@@ ming that &apos;s led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since around 19@@ 80 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass con@@ soli@@ dation , mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s of small farmers in this country .
the i@@ con@@ s like michael po@@ ll@@ an and jam@@ ie oli@@ ver in his ted prize wish both add@@ ressed this last three-@@ decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
this is a construction hel@@ met that i received two years ago at the gro@@ und@@ breaking of the largest project i , and my fir@@ m , have ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic stat@@ ements .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &apos;t we be able to conc@@ ei@@ ve of an architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation that sli@@ des se@@ am@@ less@@ ly through the project &apos;s and the cli@@ ent &apos;s con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts ?
the architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation was frank@@ ly just du@@ m@@ b .
you &apos;re going down into our lo@@ bby , go through the lo@@ bby with our own little dan@@ g@@ ly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the sta@@ ir that leads you into the audi@@ tor@@ ium .
and the solution in terms of the bal@@ con@@ ies was to use something that we all know as a sc@@ ore@@ board li@@ ft .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can r@@ ent it out .
and to re@@ mind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and i really loved this idea of the par@@ tial gli@@ mp@@ se into somebody &apos;s life .
&quot; i love how they were able to preser@@ ve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- bu@@ tter@@ flies , man@@ -@@ made fore@@ sts , li@@ me@@ stone ca@@ ves and hey , even a huge py@@ th@@ on . &quot;
so these are some ne@@ wer projects that actually aren &apos;t even launched publi@@ c@@ ly yet .
we &apos;re very used to this .
this graph that i &apos;m cli@@ cking down here is meant to be remin@@ is@@ cent of a medical he@@ art@@ beat graph , showing the exciting moments of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 ballo@@ ons , and some really sad sou@@ l holding one ballo@@ on .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which i &apos;m told is very good lu@@ ck .
one of the more tou@@ ch@@ y political subje@@ cts in b@@ hu@@ tan is the use of indian cheap labor that they im@@ port from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
but i pre@@ fer for maybe 40 to 50 .
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
and — — the nur@@ se kind of had a hy@@ ster@@ ical lau@@ gh , and i &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flo@@ od vic@@ ti@@ ms of banglades@@ h , and then i look over and my an@@ es@@ thes@@ i@@ ologist is cl@@ am@@ ping the mas@@ k on me , and i think , &quot; he looks banglades@@ hi , &quot; — — and i just have those two facts , and i just think , &quot; this could work somehow . &quot;
ed ga@@ vag@@ an : a story about kn@@ ots and surge@@ ons
now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of ble@@ ed between speech and writing .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fing@@ ered speech .
if you listen to the way black you@@ th today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; yo . &quot;
&quot; many do not know the alp@@ hab@@ et or multi@@ pli@@ cation table , cannot write gra@@ m@@ matically -- &quot; we &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 195@@ 6 . 19@@ 17 , connec@@ tic@@ ut scho@@ ol@@ teacher .
and then the third thing would be , please show me a s@@ hea@@ f of tex@@ ts written by 16@@ -year-old girls , because i would want to know where this language had developed since our times , and ide@@ ally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could exam@@ ine this l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic mira@@ cle happening right under our no@@ ses .
gol@@ an le@@ v@@ in : software art
it is extremely un@@ likely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely un@@ likely they &apos;d be able to sei@@ ze kab@@ u@@ l .
and the same is true for the tro@@ ops .
and yet , nobody listen@@ ed to them .
very , very sa@@ dly , our foreign services , the united nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what &apos;s going on .
but you need to look at context .
it makes failure invisible , in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and inevi@@ table .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
that &apos;s what a hydro@@ phili@@ c surface does .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a preg@@ nan@@ cy test .
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s a prin@@ ter , a color prin@@ ter , it prin@@ ts colors . that &apos;s what color pr@@ inter@@ s do .
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipu@@ lations , you put it on a little device , the device fil@@ ters out the blood cells , lets the ser@@ um go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
and , of course the answer is , &quot; you don &apos;t . &quot;
and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
traditional lab tests for disease diagno@@ sis can be too expensive and cum@@ ber@@ some for the regi@@ ons most in need . george whit@@ es@@ i@@ des &apos; in@@ geni@@ ous answer is a fo@@ ol@@ pro@@ of tool that can be manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red at virtu@@ ally zero cost . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named bar@@ ack obama .
and so we can look at a bunch of different vari@@ ables .
but you see demo@@ cr@@ ats versus republi@@ can , not a big difference based on who your neighb@@ ors are .
and you interact a lot with your neighb@@ ors -- people you like , people you might not know .
i &apos;m a physi@@ cian practic@@ ing with cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge technology .
he says , &quot; you see , when she said , &apos; good morning , &apos; i picked up her fi@@ fe ac@@ cent .
so within a few years , in the late 18@@ 0@@ 0s , early 19@@ 0@@ 0s , all of a sudden , the bar@@ ber surge@@ on had given way to the physi@@ cian who was trying to make a diagno@@ sis .
there &apos;s a real dis@@ jun@@ ction between the patient &apos;s perception and our own per@@ cep@@ tions as physi@@ cians of the best medical care .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of atten@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess that she needed .
the good news , it &apos;s not cancer , it &apos;s not tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is , it &apos;s not co@@ c@@ ci@@ dio@@ i@@ dom@@ y@@ co@@ sis or some ob@@ sc@@ ure f@@ ung@@ al infe@@ ction .
i would per@@ c@@ uss the ch@@ est . i would listen to the heart .
modern medicine is in dan@@ ger of losing a powerful , ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned tool : human touch . physi@@ cian and writer abra@@ ham ver@@ gh@@ ese descri@@ bes our strange new world where patients are mer@@ ely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-@@ on-@@ one physical ex@@ am .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what &apos;s the more likely explan@@ ation ?
in the case of g@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his telescop@@ e to saturn .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
i guess you can only have one mira@@ cle per building .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; nine million bi@@ cy@@ cles in bei@@ j@@ ing . &quot;
heart and blood ves@@ sel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combin@@ ed , and yet it &apos;s completely pre@@ vent@@ able for almost everybody .
imagine : many of these problems could be pre@@ v@@ ented if these babies were just kept warm .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but what do we do for a living ?
and then he went to north car@@ ol@@ ina and did it again .
and you can build an entire industry on that .
and people in white hat@@ s sa@@ il@@ ing bo@@ ats .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team .
someone stands up and says , &quot; this one is important .
&quot; what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn &apos;t even own a pair of shoes ? &quot;
being a leader gives you char@@ is@@ ma .
the sen@@ sor would have to be in@@ expensive , ra@@ pid , simple , sensitive , sel@@ ec@@ tive , and minim@@ ally invasi@@ ve .
you start with some water , po@@ ur in some nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , add anti@@ bodies , mix it up , take some paper , di@@ p it , dry it , and you can dete@@ ct cancer .
and so in the next two to five years , this sen@@ sor could poten@@ tially li@@ ft for pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer survival rates from a dis@@ mal 5@@ .@@ 5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for o@@ vari@@ an and lung cancer .
my experience , however , in the islam@@ ic world is very different .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ or@@ a .
and why does sex make babies , and babies sp@@ ell ero@@ tic disaster in cou@@ ples ?
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
and in this space between me and the other lies the ero@@ tic é@@ lan , lies that movement toward the other .
is it a place where you can express your in@@ fan@@ ti@@ le wi@@ sh@@ es ?
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the re@@ ception des@@ k .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoul@@ der all the time .
it &apos;s focus and pres@@ ence .
we managed , but sometimes those hall@@ s didn &apos;t seem exactly su@@ ited to the music i was making or had made .
they &apos;re smaller , even less rever@@ ber@@ ant , so he can write really fri@@ l@@ ly music that &apos;s very intri@@ cate -- and it works .
it meant that there could be extreme dynam@@ ics , which there weren &apos;t in some of these other kinds of music .
other sing@@ ers after him went even further .
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , pri@@ mar@@ ily the form at least , to fit these con@@ tex@@ ts , and if we make art to fit g@@ aller@@ y walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit exi@@ sting operating systems , is that how it works ?
and had such -- it was an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science .
but this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technologi@@ cal revolution .
and yet he says , &quot; he re@@ stor@@ es my sou@@ l . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen people take bene@@ ficial technologi@@ cal advan@@ ces , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about ton@@ ight , and twi@@ st them into something cor@@ rup@@ ting .
and i knew mr. do@@ br@@ yn@@ in very well , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to sit bes@@ i@@ de mr@@ s. gor@@ ba@@ che@@ v ton@@ ight .
unbe@@ ar@@ able psych@@ ological pres@@ sur@@ es bear down on us .
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die .
i &apos;ve done a lot of speaking in germany and in fr@@ ance , and in different parts of the world -- 10@@ 5 countries it &apos;s been my privi@@ lege to speak in .
essentially , he said this : &quot; if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you &apos;re wrong .
i couldn &apos;t take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .
life is a right , not coll@@ at@@ er@@ al or cas@@ ual .

the women &apos;s ch@@ ie@@ f of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dir@@ ty .
she &apos;s highly ath@@ le@@ tic .
today , we &apos;ve worked with over 300 .
so i will do this .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another li@@ beri@@ an girl , gh@@ an@@ ai@@ an girl , nigeri@@ an girl , ethi@@ op@@ ian girl standing on this ted stage .
l@@ g : you &apos;re wel@@ come .
li@@ ck@@ li@@ der for@@ es@@ a@@ w computers doing all the rou@@ tin@@ i@@ z@@ able work that was requi@@ red to pre@@ p@@ are the way for insi@@ ghts and decision making .
every interaction we have in the world is recor@@ ded by an ever growing ar@@ ray of sensor@@ s : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually pres@@ ents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
these foreign figh@@ ters had left their families in the gul@@ f , the le@@ v@@ ant and north africa to join al q@@ a@@ e@@ da in iraq .
the human goal here was to identify cam@@ ps for rel@@ oc@@ ation based on pri@@ ority need .
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quie@@ t , scre@@ aming des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ press people they don &apos;t like .
play a sport with a friend at lun@@ ch@@ time .
now i don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a fit 10@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a-@@ day office rat isn &apos;t more bal@@ an@@ ced ; it &apos;s more fit .
and that , i think , is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
as a black person in america , i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution pos@@ es the greatest risk to my health .
so how did things get so different for us ?
who prof@@ its ? does anything justi@@ fy what the local community goes through ?
and they provide habit@@ ats for our little friends !
and we are operating with a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive urban planning de@@ fic@@ it .
for his brilliant eff@@ or@@ ts , he was nearly im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ed .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore remin@@ ded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wa@@ sting our energy , intelligence and har@@ d-@@ ear@@ ned experience to that count .
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot;
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the ballo@@ ons or i can move the bu@@ g .
so i showed him .
again , it &apos;s useful to think about this analog@@ y with language .
this is completely different than automo@@ bil@@ es .
i want to talk about this .
we &apos;re interested in finding beauty that &apos;s more than just an a@@ es@@ thetic ; it &apos;s really a truth .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is disco@@ vering yourself through your art . right ?
hopefully , really understand the custom@@ er at its heart , where the custom@@ er is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
the engineers fle@@ w over , and designers got together with them , and they put their pres@@ entation together .
that &apos;s what you get fu@@ ri@@ ous about right ?
chris bang@@ le : great cars are great art
now as i was training in clinical medicine and he@@ mat@@ ology and on@@ c@@ ology and stem cell transplan@@ tation , what we had instead , cas@@ c@@ ading through the regul@@ atory network at the f@@ da , were these sub@@ stances -- ar@@ sen@@ ic , th@@ ali@@ dom@@ i@@ de and this chemical der@@ i@@ va@@ tive of ni@@ tro@@ gen mu@@ star@@ d gas .
in effect , the cancer cell was for@@ getting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it &apos;s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earli@@ est phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
because if there had been , they would have collap@@ sed under the gravi@@ ta@@ tional pull into a huge black hole .
that &apos;s our job as co@@ sm@@ ologists .
and this energy , according to einstein , exer@@ ts a push on the universe .
that impli@@ cation was studied by bol@@ tz@@ mann back in the 19@@ th century .
that &apos;s the region where entrop@@ y is low .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
i had never seen an internet .
i felt very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so i was determin@@ ed to do anything possible to recei@@ ve education .
god bl@@ ess .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually repli@@ cated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
i took it very literally , and took my bi@@ ke hel@@ met , put a little cut over there so that the proje@@ ctor actually f@@ its ni@@ c@@ ely .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand mov@@ ements , but , interest@@ ingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
and why only computers ? we can just play with pa@@ pers .
p@@ m : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
if you don &apos;t have open spaces , you &apos;ve got to go there and open spaces .
you can build nice sta@@ tions .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &#91; vi@@ cious &#93; circle to a virtual circle .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scen@@ es .
i &apos;ll get to you now the inci@@ dents of the day .
that is great , that means we &apos;re going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion tal@@ ents together .
in@@ ca sculp@@ tures are re@@ gar@@ ded as tre@@ as@@ ures in british muse@@ ums , while sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are is transl@@ ated into every major language of the earth .
darwin himself , by the way , had no dou@@ b@@ ts that the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s tail was beautiful in the eyes of the pe@@ a@@ hen .
beautiful sh@@ ell ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ es that look like something you &apos;d see at an arts and cra@@ f@@ ts fair , as well as o@@ ch@@ re body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
yes , ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ ling -- i ins@@ ist on that .
we have already an autonom@@ ous vehicle .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the sa@@ fest way to operate the car .
so it &apos;s actually a multi-@@ dimensional user interface .
you must be out of your mind . &quot;
i was leaving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ bling with my bag just as i &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly obser@@ ve , &quot; she is leaving the room . &quot;
it was at this point that events began to rapi@@ dly over@@ take me .
i used to say that these people saved me , but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they em@@ powered me to save myself , and cru@@ cially , they helped me to understand something which i &apos;d always sus@@ pe@@ cted : that my voices were a meaning@@ ful response to trau@@ matic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my ene@@ mi@@ es but a source of insi@@ ght into sol@@ vable emotional problems .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
what they remember is , of course , the great tri@@ um@@ ph , that the bri@@ ts were be@@ aten , and we won , and that the country was born .
and that makes it extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting as a place to explore .
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concent@@ rate sun@@ light .
you see the red glo@@ w in their eyes , which is the refle@@ ction of the flas@@ h@@ light .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flo@@ wers .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teen@@ a@@ gers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
and that allows me to check my ti@@ mer dis@@ cre@@ tely , here , without ben@@ ding my el@@ bo@@ w .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in sel@@ ec@@ ting sun@@ glas@@ ses , or je@@ wel@@ ry , or ac@@ cess@@ ories is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong on your face .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-@@ dimensional design , the ideas , the brand@@ ing , it all becomes deeply connected .
in fact , you can see each lo@@ go is a little bit different .
and if anybody as@@ ks why you &apos;re carrying a con@@ dom , you can just say you like the design .
the first half will be per@@ formed by the live sing@@ ers here on stage .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
my father , who had f@@ ought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
&quot; he was fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
i see traditional music like a kind of re@@ bel@@ li@@ on , in which people can really speak their voice , especially traditional songs from other parts of the former y@@ u@@ go@@ sla@@ v re@@ public .
but no , for the pro@@ test , they d@@ ressed all in white , no ma@@ ke@@ up .
women like sa@@ ken@@ a and lea@@ h and la@@ y@@ ma have hum@@ bled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assu@@ mp@@ tions of any kind .
we can de@@ milit@@ ari@@ ze societies and po@@ ur resources , instead , into reser@@ vo@@ irs of genu@@ ine security .
and i thought , &quot; well , sir , i am not a strateg@@ ist , nor am i speci@@ alist . i am mer@@ ely a story@@ t@@ eller . &quot;
so what could this mean ?
they were together while pra@@ ying .
and there are two important mes@@ sages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
and the religious police im@@ pos@@ es the supposed islam@@ ic way of life on every citi@@ zen , by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hi@@ ja@@ b , the islam@@ ic head cover .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be lo@@ y@@ al to it .
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discus@@ sed carefully .
that &apos;s an experience that not every other musli@@ m nation in the middle east had until very recently .
mu@@ staf@@ a ak@@ yo@@ l : faith versus tradition in islam
it cle@@ ars the forest , reve@@ als the trees inside .
and anti@@ body sta@@ in@@ ings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
dar@@ fu@@ r may have sli@@ pped from the news head@@ lines , but the killing and dis@@ plac@@ ement there continu@@ es as well , and the she@@ er human mis@@ ery that it creates is very hard to fa@@ tho@@ m .
th@@ us , even though every civili@@ an killed , ma@@ im@@ ed , ra@@ ped , or tor@@ tured is one too many , the fact that the number of civili@@ an cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
but then , is northern ir@@ eland a unique example , or does this kind of explan@@ ation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?
both success@@ es and fail@@ ures teach us several cri@@ tically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue .
as a photograph@@ er for national geographic , i &apos;ve portra@@ yed it for many .
mu@@ d and miner@@ als become sub@@ strate ; there are bacteria .
on land , life turned a corner . ja@@ ws formed first ; teeth came later .
extin@@ ction can come slowly , but sometimes it arri@@ ves fast .
and where it doesn &apos;t , as in green@@ land in winter , mars is still not very far .
so in australia , &quot; mo &quot; is s@@ lang for mu@@ sta@@ che , so we ren@@ am@@ ed the month of no@@ v@@ ember &quot; mov@@ ember &quot; and created some pretty basic rules , which still stand today .
and we per@@ si@@ sted , and we got 4@@ 50 guys growing mu@@ sta@@ ches , and together we raised 5@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars , and we don@@ ated every cent of that to the pro@@ state cancer foundation of australia , and that repres@@ ented at the time the single biggest don@@ ation they &apos;d ever received .
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.@@ s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infin@@ itely more money glob@@ ally than we could just in australia . and that money fu@@ els research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so we pil@@ ed into a tax@@ i , and this is our tax@@ i driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; where are you going ? &quot;
and so we said , right , we &apos;d re@@ defined char@@ ity . we need to re@@ define the way these guys operate . how do we do that ?
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grand@@ father &apos;s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
he would tell you , as he told me , &quot; i asked myself , &quot; he said , &quot; what did my grand@@ parents and my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents do to protect the forest for me ?
we have to change .
even that wasn &apos;t enough .
he would tell you , &quot; i &apos;m a colle@@ ctor , and i cu@@ rate a museum . &quot;
they have a sense of the great ar@@ c of time and their tiny place in it .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thri@@ ce .
on the ban@@ ks of a river called the indu@@ s , now in pakistan .
you should not be s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , who roll@@ s a rock up a mountain all day only to find the b@@ ou@@ l@@ der roll@@ ed down at night .
you see , the indi@@ ans also had a river that separ@@ ates the land of the living from the land of the dead .
the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator of the gy@@ m@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist &apos;s life was infin@@ ity .
there is no orche@@ str@@ a conduc@@ tor .
and i would see the ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation between my american and european colleagues , when they were dealing with india .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stran@@ ger , one requ@@ est : understand that you live in the subje@@ ctive truth , and so does he .
you &apos;re afraid if you look for your passion and don &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll feel like you &apos;re an i@@ di@@ ot , so then you make exc@@ uses about why you &apos;re not going to look for your passion .
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret .
you need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might gra@@ b you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in compar@@ ison to all the other things that interest you , and that &apos;s what passion is .
what do you want me to say ?
&quot; look kid . i had a dream once , too , but -- but . &quot;
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great career , unless -- unless , that most ev@@ o@@ ca@@ tive of all english words -- unless .
you may rec@@ all a year ago when a fire@@ stor@@ m er@@ up@@ ted after the united states pre@@ ven@@ tive services task force re@@ vie@@ wed the world &apos;s mammo@@ graph@@ y scre@@ ening liter@@ ature and issu@@ ed a gui@@ del@@ ine re@@ com@@ men@@ ding against scre@@ ening mammo@@ gra@@ ms in women in their 4@@ 0s .
so it &apos;s easy to see this tumor in the upp@@ er part of this f@@ at@@ ty breast .
and so@@ on@@ er or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
so here we were , a nuclear physi@@ c@@ ist , an intern@@ ist , soon jo@@ ined by car@@ r@@ ie hr@@ us@@ ka , a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engineer , and two radi@@ ologists , and we were trying to take on the ent@@ ren@@ ched world of mammo@@ graph@@ y with a machine that was held together by du@@ ct ta@@ pe .
here &apos;s an example from that scre@@ ening study .
we still need to complete the scre@@ ening study using the low do@@ se , and then our fin@@ dings will need to be repli@@ cated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
i can look at your financial recor@@ ds .
or should we respect his priv@@ acy , protect his dig@@ ni@@ ty and leave him alone ?
what &apos;s a moral operating system ?
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere .
if you think that way , you have a plat@@ on@@ ist moral frame@@ work .
not just because it ran@@ g earlier , but i &apos;m going to take it because i made a little calcu@@ lation .
what &apos;s the for@@ mul@@ a ?
or like k@@ ant , did i use reason to figure out what was in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally right ? &quot;
d@@ um ta da da d@@ um d@@ um ta da da d@@ um well , your musi@@ cian friend will stop you and say , &quot; you know , the theme music for your data revolution , that &apos;s an oper@@ a , that &apos;s wa@@ g@@ ner .
it &apos;s our invisible reality .
and this noise is the most neu@@ tra@@ l .
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shu@@ t it , at this point .
you have to know that today , roughly one or two every drug p@@ ills is not taken cor@@ rec@@ tly .
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment .
so , huge trage@@ dy .
because the roots of the plant are not very effective .
now we can eat local food .
so , if you believe the media accoun@@ ts , being a drug de@@ aler in the hei@@ ght of the cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine epidemic was a very glam@@ or@@ ous life , in the words of virg@@ ini@@ a po@@ stre@@ l .
and in the words of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine was the extra@@ -@@ ch@@ un@@ ky version of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce for the inner city .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
we found in our gang -- and , ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly , this was not really sort of a standard situation ; this was a time of inten@@ se violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful . but there were costs .
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
and the words of a gang member capture it quite ni@@ c@@ ely .
from there i started with sky@@ di@@ ving .
2005 i did a base jump from the ei@@ ger , from the mon@@ k and from the jung@@ frau , three very famous mountains in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot;
i think there is a soci@@ ali@@ zing dimension in , kind of , moving that bor@@ der .
is art about that ?
so the movement with your legs will change the color of your hori@@ zon .
and &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i@@ . and what does it matter ? &quot;
in the spec@@ tac@@ ular lar@@ ge-@@ scale projects he &apos;s famous for , ol@@ af@@ ur eli@@ as@@ son creates art from a pal@@ ette of space , distance , color and light . this ide@@ a-@@ pac@@ ked talk begins with an experiment in the nature of perception .
i think that &apos;s got to be sc@@ aring a lot of animals away .
we need a nas@@ a-@@ like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be explor@@ ing and prote@@ cting our life support systems here on earth .
when she was 10 years old in 19@@ 27 , she published her first book of po@@ em@@ s called &quot; the jan@@ it@@ or &apos;s boy . &quot;
and my blood fro@@ ze when i read that because i had written the pla@@ in-@@ song music 1@@ 30 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
nat@@ al@@ ie mer@@ ch@@ ant s@@ ings from her new al@@ bu@@ m , &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; leave your sleep . &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; ly@@ ri@@ cs from ne@@ ar-@@ for@@ gotten 19@@ th-@@ century poetry pair with her un@@ mista@@ k@@ able voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .
they are very different from us in body form .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with pen@@ ny patter@@ son and ko@@ ko , with sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ ru@@ m@@ bau@@ gh and kan@@ z@@ i , pan@@ ban@@ ish@@ a , ir@@ ene pe@@ p@@ per@@ berg , ale@@ x the par@@ rot , i got all excited .
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged white men , mostly midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged white men .
jo@@ ining me are three of our eight atlan@@ tic bot@@ t@@ len@@ o@@ se dolph@@ ins : 20@@ -year-old ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke , who was our first dolph@@ in born here , her four@@ -year-old daughter ba@@ y@@ ley , and her half sister , 1@@ 1@@ -year-old may@@ a .
that &apos;s a number only that con@@ gress can appreci@@ ate .
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these inter@@ actions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
all right , well thank you all so much for jo@@ ining us .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
they have graphic designers . what ?
and this whole list of pages on facebook de@@ dic@@ ated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
remember that image from the beginning ?
and i &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and i &apos;m just going to post it on facebook with kind of &quot; isra@@ eli@@ s for peace &quot; or something .
as you can see , a project evol@@ ves through a series of generations of design meetings .
but then we had a meeting with a chinese busin@@ ess@@ man who saw our design and said , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the chinese character for the word &apos; people . &apos; &quot; so , appar@@ ently this is how you write &quot; people , &quot; as in the people &apos;s re@@ public of china .
china symbo@@ li@@ zed by the dra@@ g@@ on .
you can try it .
if you do come to cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , you will probably see an instal@@ lation by ai wei@@ we@@ i , the chinese artist .
so if you go back into the par@@ king , into the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors , it &apos;s almost like travel@@ ing into a par@@ alle@@ l universe from cars and colors , into this sort of sou@@ th-@@ facing urban o@@ as@@ is .
and our main idea was to sort of sam@@ ple the seven most significant mountains of the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ t them into urban and architec@@ tural structures , in@@ habit@@ able of human life .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
and then you ask , why econom@@ ists ?
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
the inci@@ dence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infe@@ cted every year .
so again , what we focus on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than treatment , at first rate .
of course , that &apos;s main@@ ly because climate change has good pictures .
the only two requi@@ re@@ ments were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
over the past hundred years , the combin@@ ation of liber@@ al democracy and private capit@@ alism has helped to cat@@ ap@@ ult the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is em@@ bo@@ died by china that is gather@@ ing moment@@ um am@@ on@@ gst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fa@@ st@@ est impro@@ v@@ ements in living standards in the shor@@ test period of time .
i &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shif@@ ts oc@@ curr@@ ing around what china is doing in the democratic stance .
but i put it to you that if the united states and european countries want to re@@ main glob@@ ally influ@@ enti@@ al , they may have to consider co@@ operating in the short term in order to compe@@ te , and by that , they might have to focus more ag@@ gressi@@ vely on economic out@@ comes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accoun@@ table and create the democra@@ cies that we really want .
in this v@@ ein , we can increase economic growth .
that if you live in the best climate , in san die@@ go in the united states , or in the sh@@ it@@ ti@@ est climate , in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very sil@@ ly reasons , it rema@@ ins statisti@@ cally true that there are more geor@@ ges living in geor@@ gi@@ a and there are more den@@ nis@@ es becoming den@@ ti@@ sts and there are more pau@@ las who are married to paul than statisti@@ cally vi@@ able .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about ty@@ po@@ graph@@ y , even though we worked with those animals not so success@@ fully .
after about three days , the bub@@ bles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
and using indi@@ go , make it anti-@@ micro@@ bi@@ al .
su@@ z@@ an@@ ne , just a curi@@ osity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random .
ba@@ o y@@ on@@ g@@ xi@@ u : &quot; my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i mar@@ ry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only mar@@ ry an ordinary wor@@ ker , so i &apos;m not in a rus@@ h . &quot;
many artic@@ les calcu@@ late : how long would it take for this wor@@ ker to work in order to ear@@ n enough money to buy what he &apos;s making ?
another time , after m@@ in had already left the hand@@ bag factory , her yo@@ unger sister came to visit , bringing two co@@ ach sig@@ nature hand@@ bag@@ s as gif@@ ts .
thank you .
in 2009 , there were 500 bom@@ b bla@@ sts across pakistan .
step two : they teach the children the kor@@ an , which is islam &apos;s ho@@ li@@ est book , in arab@@ ic , a language these children do not understand and cannot speak .
this boy is called mess@@ oud .
we &apos;ve flo@@ wn the cas@@ sin@@ i spac@@ ec@@ raft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these je@@ ts , into the den@@ ser regi@@ ons of these je@@ ts , so that now we have come away with some very pre@@ cise com@@ posi@@ tional measu@@ re@@ ments .
we &apos;re always sort of small in the face of its expan@@ se .
and that connection is an un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally physical process .
they looked for the un@@ wired places , and that &apos;s meant north and south , pri@@ mar@@ ily these c@@ ables to africa .
thank you .
and this material that &apos;s de@@ pos@@ ited either starts as a liquid form or a material po@@ w@@ der form .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
but it &apos;s very hard to create that in standard ways .
you can just make it physi@@ cally on the spot .
we &apos;re now , instead of shi@@ pping a product across the world , we &apos;re sending data across the internet .
businesses want different things .
but it wasn &apos;t just us . even in the musli@@ m world , his definition of ji@@ had began to gain accep@@ tan@@ ce .
what does that mean for us in the west ?
but that &apos;s still not reason for us to dis@@ engage , because we &apos;ve seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
al ja@@ ze@@ era brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , ex@@ posed the hypo@@ cris@@ y of o@@ sam@@ a bin laden and al q@@ a@@ e@@ da , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclu@@ sions .
thank you .
i was stru@@ ck immediately by the kin@@ dness and the gent@@ len@@ ess in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
she lives with all of that inse@@ curity , and in fact , in janu@@ ary , during the eth@@ ni@@ c ri@@ ots , she was ch@@ ased from her home and had to find a new sha@@ ck in which she would live .
i truly believe it &apos;s where dig@@ ni@@ ty starts .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
i had just taken tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try in high school , i learned about the par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a and how it could concent@@ rate ra@@ ys of light to a single focus .
i &apos;m gla@@ d you heard earlier today , bat@@ ter@@ ies are un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably energy -- lack of den@@ sity compared to fuel .
you take a problem that you can &apos;t solve with a p@@ ure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at gu@@ ess@@ ing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mu@@ tations -- and you use natural sele@@ ction to kill off not as good solutions .
so what you see here is 12 separate pe@@ t@@ als , that each could be controlled with individual micro@@ process@@ ors that would only cost a dollar .
so , once you have mo@@ bility , now you &apos;re making a lot of eng@@ ines because you &apos;ve got lots of un@@ its , as op@@ posed to ste@@ am ships or big fac@@ tor@@ ies where you &apos;re not making as many un@@ its , so this was the engine that ended up benef@@ iting from mass production where all the other eng@@ ines didn &apos;t benefit .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you &apos;re only shif@@ ting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
so now you put the two things together .
so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the pe@@ t@@ als were individu@@ ally see@@ king .
it &apos;s just un@@ belie@@ vable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &apos;m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
bill gro@@ ss : a solar energy system that tra@@ cks the sun
but still , we look at the pieces .
and out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few do@@ zen pa@@ pers on a few do@@ zen processes or molecules .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
so , good things come out of , you know , in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
i work for the new yor@@ ker , and i do co@@ vers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and u@@ tter end of the world as we knew it .
and &quot; would &quot; is co@@ co chan@@ el &apos;s lo@@ ver , &quot; should &quot; is edi@@ th si@@ t@@ well , and &quot; could &quot; is an aug@@ ust s@@ ander subject .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stu@@ ff@@ ed spin@@ o@@ za , but we do have a stu@@ ff@@ ed pa@@ v@@ lo@@ v &apos;s dog , and i vis@@ ited him in the museum of hy@@ gi@@ ene in st@@ . pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , in russi@@ a .
i received a box in the mail and it was wra@@ pped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s mis@@ er@@ able because , you know , we &apos;re from russi@@ a .
ma@@ ir@@ a kal@@ man : the illu@@ strated woman
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , there &apos;s no real sense of separ@@ ation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that i feel for these people .
so , as we are clim@@ bing the tree , some of the things that we &apos;re doing in order to clim@@ b the tree are actually under@@ min@@ ing the tree &apos;s very ro@@ ot .
they &apos;ll be cooking , cle@@ an@@ ing , buying things , sh@@ opp@@ ing , building . but they aren &apos;t here .
we were hop@@ ing that it w@@ ass going to have a kind of evil , spi@@ der@@ y walk , but instead it created this pretty l@@ ame way of moving forward .
kat@@ r@@ ina showed us that we cannot completely dep@@ end on government to have read@@ iness in hand , to be capable of hand@@ ling things .
for example , all mas@@ ks are made in china .
add on pan@@ de@@ mic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
let &apos;s see , should we order that all pe@@ ts be kept in@@ do@@ ors ?
in the s@@ ars epidemic , we learned in h@@ ong kon@@ g that most of trans@@ mission was because people were re@@ moving their mas@@ ks impro@@ per@@ ly .
every city , coun@@ ty , state did their own thing .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recy@@ cle mas@@ ks .
clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually atten@@ u@@ ates , and ce@@ ases to be a le@@ th@@ al virus to humanity , and fin@@ ds other ho@@ sts .
in terms of where we are in science with dna identi@@ fication capac@@ i@@ ties and so on , it &apos;s not that far off .
we &apos;ve never seen anything even re@@ mot@@ ely like this before . &quot;
it &apos;s really man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able . you have a hand@@ -@@ held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceler@@ ation , bra@@ king , go in rever@@ se if you like , also have bra@@ king .
okay , i che@@ ated , it was a m@@ ere 20 seconds .
but in america you have to explain . what are clu@@ bs ?
i found two trees -- but not any kind of trees , trees with character -- and then a very long rop@@ e .
the mur@@ mu@@ r of the city dis@@ sol@@ ves into a squ@@ all whose chil@@ ling power i no longer feel .
you know that , right ?
i make the do@@ ve appear .
i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and what i &apos;d like to do is take you up to the can@@ op@@ y , not by putting all of you into rop@@ es and har@@ n@@ esses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called &quot; hero@@ es of the high fron@@ tier . &quot;
we &apos;ve done stri@@ pping experiments where we &apos;ve re@@ moved ma@@ ts of epi@@ phy@@ tes and looked at the rates of re@@ col@@ oni@@ zation .
we consu@@ lt to the media about can@@ op@@ y questions ; we have a can@@ op@@ y new@@ sle@@ tter ; we have an email li@@ st@@ ser@@ v .
i saw the power of du@@ ke &apos;s song with urban you@@ th -- an audience , you know , i as a midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged professor , i don &apos;t have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convin@@ cing them of the importance of wild@@ lands .
i brought my scientific colleagues and sustain@@ ability prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers into the prison .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional family .
so we are moving to this democra@@ ti@@ zation of information , and i &apos;ve been in this field for quite a while .
so that &apos;s open-@@ source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law .
skep@@ tic@@ ism , because you must always be challen@@ ging .
they &apos;re watching all of us . they &apos;ve du@@ g a bas@@ ement , and they &apos;ve built a sp@@ y center to try and run algorith@@ ms and figure out which ones of us are trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome , and if any of us com@@ pla@@ in about that , we &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted for terror@@ ism .
now , when you think of a coral re@@ e@@ f , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , el@@ abor@@ ate cor@@ als and lots of bright , color@@ ful fis@@ hes and things .
over time , those gas molecules dis@@ solve into your blood and tis@@ su@@ es and start to fill you up .
and this ri@@ g was actually used for a di@@ ve of 300 feet .
now , as we brea@@ the , we produce carbon dio@@ xide , and that carbon dio@@ xide needs to be sc@@ ru@@ b@@ bed out of the system .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move on to something that &apos;s kind of much more interesting .
we also see sharks , much more regul@@ arly than i would have expected to .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
the reason i show this -- not to put a dow@@ ner on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosoph@@ y of life in general , which is that we all have two goals .
despite the fact that each and every one of these dis@@ orders origin@@ ates in the brain , most of these dis@@ orders are diagno@@ sed sol@@ ely on the basis of obser@@ vable behavior .
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagno@@ sed with autis@@ m are actually suffering from hidden brain sei@@ zur@@ es .
they don &apos;t come back several times , so it really chron@@ ic@@ les a journey .
richard sau@@ l wur@@ man : i remember hearing him talk at pen@@ n .
lou@@ is ka@@ hn , yes !
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
where &apos;s the line that mar@@ ks that ?
zir@@ con@@ s that are min@@ ed in the jack h@@ ills of western australia , zir@@ con@@ s taken from the jack h@@ ills of western australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the orig@@ in of the planet there was ab@@ und@@ ant water and perhaps even life .
now dra@@ ke did not discover ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a pas@@ sing air@@ craft , and that &apos;s that ter@@ restri@@ al technology can inter@@ f@@ ere with the search for ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al technology .
so , if that &apos;s right , why did we only capture four out of those 15@@ 1 minds ?
come with me to the bottom of the world , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the highest , dri@@ est , win@@ dies@@ t , and yes , col@@ dest region on earth -- more ar@@ id than the sahar@@ a and , in parts , col@@ der than mars .
but under the surface is a hi@@ ve of industrial activity peri@@ o@@ di@@ cally , this dri@@ ll , like a bi@@ op@@ sy need@@ le , pl@@ ung@@ es thousands of feet deep into the ice to extra@@ ct a mar@@ row of g@@ ases and is@@ ot@@ op@@ es for analysis .
don &apos;t we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our sett@@ led civilization ?
the old story about climate protection is that it &apos;s co@@ stly , or it would have been done already .
and serious competition from europe , from korea , and next is china , which will soon be a major net ex@@ por@@ ter of cars .
it &apos;s finan@@ ce@@ able in the private capital market .
this is not very gra@@ ti@@ fying after more than a century of de@@ vot@@ ed engineering effort .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stam@@ ping steel .
for example , fe@@ e-@@ b@@ ates , a combin@@ ation of a fe@@ e and a re@@ b@@ ate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of in@@ efficient vehi@@ cles and cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ingly pay you a re@@ b@@ ate for efficient vehi@@ cles .
and make the transition to more efficient vehi@@ cles go faster .
there &apos;s six billion dollars on the table .
we launched two ti@@ tles in oc@@ tober -- &quot; rock@@ et@@ t &apos;s new school &quot; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rock@@ et@@ t beginning her first day of school in ei@@ gh@@ th grade at a brand new place , with a blan@@ k s@@ late , which allows girls to play with the question of , &quot; what will i be like when i &apos;m older ? &quot;
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous and a real big tom@@ boy , you would think that girls &apos; games were kin@@ da s@@ is@@ sy .
b@@ l : i &apos;m going to fa@@ st-@@ forward to the decision point because i know i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
bren@@ da lau@@ re@@ l : games for girls
i also need al@@ co@@ hol and mor@@ ph@@ ine , because it &apos;s the only way i can work . &quot;
many soci@@ ologists like ve@@ bl@@ en and wol@@ fe would argue that the reason why we take orig@@ ins so seriously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ bs , because we &apos;re focused on status .
there are now do@@ zens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you &apos;re drin@@ king the expensive stuff , it ta@@ stes better to you .
people have mur@@ dered those that they loved , belie@@ ving that they were mur@@ der@@ ing an im@@ poster .
then we asked them , &quot; how much would you pay for george clo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ ater ? &quot;
they just don &apos;t like it .
as many of you know , this is the com@@ position where the pian@@ ist si@@ ts at a ben@@ ch , op@@ ens up the piano and si@@ ts and does nothing for four minutes and 3@@ 3 seconds -- that period of sil@@ ence .
paul blo@@ om : the orig@@ ins of pleasure
so what i &apos;m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main fe@@ atures of my discipl@@ ine -- evi@@ den@@ ce-@@ based medicine .
&quot; a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
and the cla@@ im was fish oil p@@ ills improve school performance and behavior in main@@ stream children .
two sugar p@@ ills a day be@@ ats one sugar p@@ ill a day .
again , not an in@@ san@@ e do@@ se , not an illegal do@@ se , but very much at the high end of normal .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappe@@ ared .
we already have the data showing that it redu@@ ces the du@@ ration of your flu by a few hours .
and pretty soon , they began shi@@ pping that coal , ton by ton , ra@@ il car by ra@@ il car , bo@@ at@@ load by bo@@ at@@ load , back to china and el@@ se@@ where around the world .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
there &apos;s this thing , this milit@@ ari@@ zation of the world , and it &apos;s cen@@ ter@@ ed right in the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re chri@@ sti@@ ans .
and this word here , george bush called this war a cr@@ us@@ ade .
you &apos;ve got to see this -- bi@@ ble boot camp .
of course , you got it wrong .
and what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman recei@@ ving a chinese fla@@ g because her loved one has died in america in the coal u@@ pris@@ ing .
can you feel their an@@ ger , their fear , their ra@@ ge at what has happened in their country ?
and suddenly , without reali@@ zing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently .
communication walls , i don &apos;t have to tell you -- the internet -- have come tu@@ m@@ bling down .
more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
and that means an increase in@@ cen@@ tive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world .
i think of the great indian mathemati@@ cian , ra@@ manu@@ j@@ an .
t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century : a little bit over two percent .
when i was writing up my notes oil was $ 1@@ 40 per bar@@ re@@ l .
if we were to wi@@ pe out insects alone , just that group alone , on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappe@@ ar from the land .
6@@ 0,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.@@ 5 million have been esti@@ ma@@ ted to exist .
what will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this under@@ way seriously ?
human@@ -@@ forced climate change alone -- again , if un@@ ab@@ ated -- could elimin@@ ate a quar@@ ter of survi@@ ving species during the next five decades .
it makes all key information about life on earth acc@@ essi@@ ble to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .
well , commercial hun@@ ting happened .
sor@@ row , an@@ ger , m@@ our@@ ning .
there &apos;s just some bits that are band@@ -@@ ta@@ iled pi@@ ge@@ on .
al@@ ber@@ to worked with the bu@@ car@@ do in spa@@ in .
well birds are pretty har@@ d-@@ wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supp@@ le@@ ment it , part of ben &apos;s idea is to use hom@@ ing pi@@ ge@@ ons to help train the young pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons how to flo@@ ck and how to find their way to their old ne@@ sting gro@@ unds and fe@@ eding gro@@ unds .
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
there &apos;s going to be un@@ inten@@ ded consequences .
he ran and worked in a factory .
and i liked making that book because i loved using my imagination , and that &apos;s what writing is .
i dre@@ w funny pictures of my teachers -- -- and i passed them around .
i just wanted a video camera .
i set up a studio and i tried to get published .
mr@@ s. al@@ isch cut in front of the line and said , &quot; i taught him how to read . &quot;
i said , &quot; mr@@ s. al@@ isch , how are you ? &quot;
when i was vis@@ iting my ter@@ min@@ ally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ?
this is affected massi@@ vely by rever@@ ber@@ ation time , how rever@@ ber@@ ant a room is .
what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0@@ .@@ 4@@ -@@ second rever@@ ber@@ ation time ?
i love that phr@@ ase .
in &quot; up@@ wake &quot; buildings wear su@@ its , zero ta@@ p dan@@ ces on a giant key@@ board , c@@ lon@@ es himself with a scan@@ ner , t@@ ames and whi@@ ps the computer mi@@ ce , sa@@ ils away into dre@@ am@@ scap@@ e from a single piece of paper and laun@@ ches into space .
but the teachers came to me after@@ ward and told me they hadn &apos;t seen the kids that atten@@ tive .
it &apos;s motion and emotion .
in the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- where i come from -- you actually never see a pi@@ g , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pig@@ s .
and in che@@ es@@ e@@ ca@@ ke and all kinds of des@@ ser@@ ts , like cho@@ col@@ ate m@@ ous@@ se , ti@@ ra@@ mis@@ u , van@@ ill@@ a pu@@ d@@ ding , everything that &apos;s cool@@ ed in the super@@ market , there &apos;s gel@@ a@@ tin to make it look good .
and can you send me a bul@@ let ? &quot;
chri@@ sti@@ en mein@@ der@@ ts@@ ma , auth@@ or of &quot; pi@@ g 0@@ 50@@ 4@@ 9 &quot; looks at the ast@@ on@@ ishing after@@ life of the ordinary pi@@ g , parts of which make their way into at least 18@@ 5 non-@@ por@@ k products , from bul@@ lets to artificial he@@ arts .
tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , they &apos;re in sho@@ ck .
i have things to do , people to im@@ press , and places to go . &quot;
will you like all your children ? of course not .
now , this is one model of how language comes to be : nam@@ ely , it &apos;s leg@@ is@@ l@@ ated by an acade@@ my .
a handy thing to have , because language is infin@@ ite , and you can &apos;t just par@@ rot back the sent@@ ences that you &apos;ve heard .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; ment@@ al@@ ese . &quot;
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; far@@ go . &quot;
in dat@@ ing , the transition from friend@@ ship to sex can lead to , not@@ ori@@ ously , various forms of aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness , and as can sex in the work@@ place , in which we call the conflict between a domin@@ ant and a sexual relationship &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ s@@ ment . &quot;
so you get the best of both worl@@ ds .
i tend to win those argu@@ ments , because i know the tricks .
so we have these models -- argument as war , argument as pro@@ of , and argument as performance .
oh , and one more thing , and as an educ@@ ator , this is the one that really bo@@ thers me : if argument is war , then there &apos;s an impli@@ c@@ it equ@@ ation of learning with losing .
what we need is new ex@@ it strategi@@ es for argu@@ ments .
why do we argue ? to out@@ -@@ reason our op@@ pon@@ ents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! ... right ? philosop@@ her dan@@ iel h@@ . co@@ hen shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- mis@@ ses out on the real benefits of eng@@ aging in active dis@@ agre@@ ement . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organis@@ m and then appl@@ ying it .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
life can &apos;t afford to do that . how does life make things ?
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
power of shape : here &apos;s a wh@@ ale . we &apos;ve seen that the fin@@ s of this wh@@ ale have tu@@ ber@@ cles on them . and those little bu@@ mp@@ s actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
and we use all of them , even the tox@@ ic ones .
ok , so that &apos;s the heal@@ ing one .
and in ways both big and small , the narra@@ tive of the vic@@ tim shapes the way we see women .
why are you so passionate ? &quot;
micro@@ fin@@ ance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-@@ suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ency and self-@@ respect , but we must move beyond micro@@ -@@ hop@@ es and micro@@ -@@ ambi@@ tions for women , because they have so much greater hop@@ es for themselves .
you know why ?
and when i was appl@@ ying to business school and felt certain i couldn &apos;t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my a@@ unt who survi@@ ved years of be@@ at@@ ings at the hand of her husband and es@@ cap@@ ed a marriage of ab@@ use with only her dig@@ ni@@ ty in@@ t@@ act .
but it was a little bit bor@@ ing .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with p@@ ure , consi@@ stent no@@ vel@@ ty .
and now all be@@ ts are off .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
about 10 years ago , i was at a cock@@ tail party with a friend of mine , and we &apos;re sitting there , and he was com@@ pla@@ ining about the cro@@ ws that he had seen that were all over his y@@ ard and making a big m@@ ess .
and in all that area , they &apos;re only r@@ ar@@ ely found bre@@ eding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
so , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that cro@@ ws are really , really intelligent .
in fact , that &apos;s old hat for cro@@ ws .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the cro@@ ws coming back .
i think that cro@@ ws can be trained to do other things .
so the management of electro@@ lu@@ x took our pi@@ le , our list of in@@ centi@@ ves , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , &quot; wow , this is the most gener@@ ous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here .
as we know , only half the states have op@@ ted in .
every region has something to offer , and if you created a competition , it respe@@ cts the states and it respe@@ cts fe@@ der@@ alism .
if you hadn &apos;t noticed , our media climate generally provi@@ des a very di@@ stor@@ ted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and i think that &apos;s going to change .
when they &apos;re monit@@ or@@ ing your cli@@ ck@@ stream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time fig@@ uring out your age , your gender and your income .
the future entertain@@ ment media that we &apos;re going to see is going to be very dat@@ a-@@ driven , and it &apos;s going to be based on the information that we as@@ certain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action .
up goes the bird , out come the words , &quot; ju@@ ani@@ to , ju@@ ani@@ to , ven@@ te a com@@ er m@@ i hi@@ jo ! &quot;
you might wan@@ na a@@ ver@@ t your ga@@ ze , because that is a new@@ t about to re@@ generate its lim@@ b , and sha@@ king hands spre@@ ads more ger@@ ms than k@@ is@@ sing .
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &apos;s the big ar@@ row -- and the pen@@ is on the right . the hand ho@@ vering .
and i said , &quot; so , could you do it right here ? &quot;
i actually suggest@@ ed to -- there is a resear@@ cher at the university of al@@ ab@@ ama who does or@@ gas@@ m research .
doctors back then were rou@@ tin@@ ely telling men the importance of pleas@@ uring their wi@@ ves .
british sex@@ ologist ro@@ y le@@ v@@ in has spe@@ cul@@ ated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic and frequ@@ ent ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ ors .
and i said , &quot; so why don &apos;t you just stimu@@ late the cli@@ tor@@ is of the pi@@ g ?
and the woman would have sex with it .
and yet , despite everything going really well for john , he was strug@@ gling , fighting addi@@ ction and a gri@@ pping depression .
now i know that seems lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
pull the k@@ not .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these un@@ organized red squ@@ ar@@ es day after day .
we are only happy when things are in order .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
and i think the whole thing ad@@ ds up much better if you do it like this .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
and i started to bring some order into some fla@@ gs .
he had a di@@ xi@@ eland ja@@ zz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover lou@@ is arm@@ strong tun@@ es .
and mom@@ s gra@@ b their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t st@@ are ! &quot;
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; i &apos;m no longer a vic@@ tim .
it &apos;s as though in@@ tent is an essential compon@@ ent for humanity .
in fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?
i was in a wheel@@ chair ; i didn &apos;t look like a lo@@ ot@@ er .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circum@@ stances : living with in@@ tent .
i didn &apos;t have an ex@@ act address , but i knew his name , ab@@ ed , i knew that he lived in a town of 15@@ ,000 , k@@ far kar@@ a , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this hol@@ y city , he broke my ne@@ ck .
but ab@@ ed did not slow , and on that x@@ er@@ ox@@ ed piece of paper , my ne@@ ck again broke , and again , i was left without an@@ ger .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the in@@ fi@@ deli@@ ty of a par@@ ent or spo@@ use , money in@@ her@@ ited ?
and as i sat con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating what to say , a woman approach@@ ed in a black sha@@ w@@ l and black ro@@ be .
no , i was quie@@ t . i was quie@@ t because i had not come for truth .
&quot; um , ab@@ ed , &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
yes , contr@@ ast .
i built the head . they built the body .
and it sees multiple people in a scene , remem@@ bers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remem@@ ber@@ ing people .
someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? &quot;
and i did a little calcu@@ lation of this .
for example , dan p@@ ink &apos;s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven &apos;t seen it : &quot; drop car@@ rot . drop stick . bring meaning . &quot;
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i &apos;d been too much on google l@@ ately .
and i would only pay $ 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it .
okay , part one starts back in 19@@ 29 when the great astronom@@ er ed@@ win hu@@ b@@ ble realized that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all rus@@ hing away from us , establi@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ching , it &apos;s exp@@ and@@ ing .
expres@@ sed in the relevant unit , it is spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ arly small .
so partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the streng@@ ths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determin@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions .
and in those univer@@ ses that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form .
because such a mechan@@ ism has been found by co@@ sm@@ ologists trying to understand the big bang .
you see , we learned that our universe is not sta@@ tic , that space is exp@@ and@@ ing , that that expan@@ sion is spee@@ ding up and that there might be other univer@@ ses all by carefully exam@@ ining fa@@ int pin@@ points of star@@ light coming to us from dist@@ ant galaxies .
we can understand how to understand the data from the micro@@ wave background radiation that was set down 13@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago -- and yet , we can do calcu@@ lations today to predict how it will look and it mat@@ ches .
you &apos;re going to meet mil@@ o for the first time .
you can le@@ an back , but the camera will change its perspective depen@@ ding on which way you &apos;re looking .
mil@@ o : i wonder how deep it is .
now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a ma@@ gi@@ cian &apos;s trick .
you cle@@ an@@ ed up my room .
and suddenly she sees a t@@ ank am@@ bling down the main road of sar@@ a@@ je@@ vo kno@@ cking everything out of its path .
i believe a story there has to be told .
and that &apos;s pretty much why i do it .
and all i can really do is hope , not to poli@@ cy@@ makers or politicians , because as much as i &apos;d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don &apos;t del@@ u@@ de myself .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
just fast forward 10 years .
as fast as we can res@@ et our computers , the brain activity shif@@ ts to start repres@@ enting this new tool , as if this too was a part of that pri@@ mate &apos;s body .
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &apos;t hi@@ re cap@@ tain kir@@ k and spo@@ ck to do the job ; after all , they were very profi@@ cient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot;
why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
and that brings me to my first major of two ten@@ ets of &quot; half the sky . &quot;
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they dep@@ end upon the breast , and the breast shows no son pre@@ ference .
so what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
so that meant she was in@@ continent ; she couldn &apos;t control her wa@@ stes .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-@@ law told her son , &quot; i think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
the tw@@ ins started producing milk .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
s@@ her@@ y@@ l wu@@ dun@@ n &apos;s book &quot; half the sky &quot; investi@@ gates the op@@ pres@@ sion of women glob@@ ally . her stories sho@@ ck . only when women in developing countries have equal access to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human resources .
why not ? i mean , that &apos;s what we do .
and this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cultural adap@@ tation , as anthropo@@ logi@@ sts call this accu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bu@@ st@@ ling and te@@ em@@ ing everyday lives .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to co@@ operate am@@ on@@ gst others .
and this is why our species has pro@@ sper@@ ed around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind b@@ ars in zo@@ os , langu@@ ishing .
and this is also true of some remote oce@@ an@@ ic is@@ lands .
to put it this way , nature knows no other circum@@ stance in which func@@ tion@@ ally equivalent tra@@ its co@@ exist .
biolog@@ ist mark pa@@ gel shares an intri@@ gu@@ ing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &quot; social technology &quot; that allowed early human tri@@ bes to access a powerful new tool : co@@ operation .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its ac@@ compan@@ ying image , and how the image is trans@@ formed by the text and the text by the image .
this is the only fe@@ der@@ ally fund@@ ed site where it is legal to cul@@ tiv@@ ate can@@ n@@ ab@@ is for scientific research in the united states .
this is the death star .
for the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wr@@ on@@ g@@ ful con@@ vi@@ ction was mista@@ ken identi@@ fication .
he ended up ser@@ ving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for ra@@ pe and rob@@ ber@@ y .
last year alone , 99 fe@@ der@@ ally dec@@ lar@@ ed dis@@ ast@@ ers were on fi@@ le with fe@@ ma , from j@@ op@@ lin , mis@@ sour@@ i , and t@@ us@@ cal@@ o@@ o@@ sa , al@@ ab@@ ama , to the central texas wild@@ fir@@ es that just happened recently .
so the first idea i had , ini@@ tially , was just to go the fe@@ der@@ al and state governments and go , &quot; here , take it , for free . &quot;
our school would show bill n@@ ye the science guy .
we have da@@ wn or@@ bit@@ ing v@@ est@@ a , and we have over here new hori@@ z@@ ons on a straight shot to plu@@ to .
there &apos;s a point to be made here .
so given that that &apos;s true , how good are we at increasing our happiness ?
we also find that people are more a@@ verse to losing than they are happy to gain .
so when people &apos;s symptom@@ s go away , they tend to re@@ cu@@ r , because there isn &apos;t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gra@@ titude , what are the positive emotions .
it wouldn &apos;t eat . it wouldn &apos;t sleep . it wouldn &apos;t have sex .
and even studies of co@@ operation show that co@@ operation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain .
i sei@@ ze comm@@ and by physical pro@@ w@@ ess , and i keep it by be@@ ating my ch@@ est , and you make sub@@ mis@@ sive gest@@ ures .
i end with a few quot@@ es .
why would you choose rat@@ s ?
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a c@@ age with a hole , and actually the animal lear@@ ns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target sc@@ ent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
it means that , if you have t@@ .b. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be dete@@ cted , but will just die from t@@ .b. secon@@ dar@@ y infe@@ ctions and so on .
and by just pres@@ enting the sam@@ ples once more to the rat@@ s and lo@@ op@@ ing those results back , we were able to increase case dete@@ ction rates by over 30 percent .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
now , what is the signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of these mirror neurons ?
in other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , neuron in the so@@ ma@@ to@@ sensor@@ y cortex in the sensor@@ y region of the brain fir@@ es .
it emer@@ ges from our understanding of basic neuro@@ science .
so , that &apos;s 20 micro@@ meters across , that pollen grain there .
this is a be@@ e &apos;s leg with the pollen gl@@ om@@ med onto it from a mal@@ low plant .
four very different habit@@ ats might look similar , but they &apos;ve got very different pollen sig@@ natur@@ es .
it &apos;s certainly what i learned when i was training .
we have effective therap@@ ies now .
and she started , the women &apos;s health initiative .
some women have those heart attac@@ ks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it ero@@ des , doesn &apos;t completely fill with c@@ lot , symptom@@ s are sub@@ tle , ek@@ g fin@@ dings are different -- fe@@ mal@@ e-@@ pattern .
now what are the impli@@ cations of that ?
and those little red bo@@ xes are dea@@ ths .
we still have two to three more women dying for every man .
so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge , we have a lot of lives to save .
we copy this in the lab by out@@ fit@@ ting cell culture systems with electro@@ des .
and in the case of the fl@@ or@@ a in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
but there &apos;s also a scientific reason that dro@@ ve this project , which was to use this natural lon@@ git@@ u@@ din@@ al data to understand the process of how a child lear@@ ns language -- that child being my son .
the way to interpre@@ t this appar@@ ently simple graph is , on the ver@@ tical is an indi@@ cation of how complex care@@ gi@@ ver u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces are based on the l@@ ength of u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces .
now we free@@ ze the action , 30 minutes , we turn time into the ver@@ tical axis , and we open up for a view of these interaction tra@@ ces we &apos;ve just left behind .
this has become my favorite way of vide@@ ograph@@ ing just about any space .
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the conne@@ ctive tissue of social graph@@ s and how they rel@@ ate to content .
and then i went on to refle@@ ct , &quot; isn &apos;t it amazing , this entire dat@@ ab@@ ase , all these recor@@ dings , i &apos;m going to hand off to you and to your sister &quot; -- who arrived two years later -- &quot; and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-@@ experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? &quot;
mit resear@@ cher de@@ b ro@@ y wanted to understand how his inf@@ ant son learned language -- so he wired up his house with vide@@ oc@@ ameras to catch every moment of his son &apos;s life , then par@@ sed 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video to watch &quot; ga@@ a@@ a@@ a &quot; slowly turn into &quot; water . &quot; ast@@ on@@ ishing , dat@@ a-@@ rich research with deep impli@@ cations for how we learn .
a second part of the brain is called the dor@@ sal stream .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual inter@@ ro@@ gation .
secon@@ dly , making them inter@@ active .
this is a laun@@ dry ch@@ ute , and this right here is a sho@@ e last .
but i get a lot of toi@@ lets , and so you just dis@@ pat@@ ch a toi@@ let with a ham@@ mer , and then you have l@@ um@@ p@@ y ti@@ les .
but you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to s@@ wing between one of two perspe@@ c@@ tives .
and so if something isn &apos;t standard , &quot; o@@ ops , du@@ mp@@ ster . &quot; &quot; o@@ ops &quot; this . &quot; o@@ ops , war@@ ped . &quot;
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with car@@ bon@@ ated pr@@ une ju@@ ice .
that exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates and continu@@ es this model .
that is , our hous@@ ing has become a com@@ modi@@ ty .
in this funny and insi@@ ght@@ ful talk , buil@@ der dan phil@@ li@@ ps t@@ ours us through a do@@ zen homes he &apos;s built in texas using recycl@@ ed and rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed materials in wil@@ dly creative ways . brilliant , low-@@ tech design details will re@@ fresh your own creative drive . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
there is no more dra@@ stic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a sever@@ e head in@@ j@@ ury .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses that are not self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ ting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be scre@@ en@@ ed for and dete@@ cted and cor@@ rec@@ ted and avoid their acade@@ mic failure .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
imagine the blood flo@@ wing through your body -- i was told at u@@ cl@@ a medical center -- as one se@@ aled system .
so it goes in and it sta@@ ys there .
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some diffic@@ ul@@ ty ...
and if you walk faster , if i walk faster , it dete@@ cts what &apos;s called the time inter@@ val , which is the inter@@ val between each he@@ el li@@ ft .
and i started in our medical university , kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a institute , an under@@ graduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swe@@ dis@@ h college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &apos;m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-@@ test when they came .
now what has happened since 196@@ 2 ? we want to see the change .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
ye@@ men , civil war . united arab e@@ mi@@ rate , money which was quite equ@@ ally and well used .
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can &apos;t disc@@ uss universal access to hiv &#91; medicine &#93; for that qu@@ inti@@ le up here with the same strategy as down here . the impro@@ vement of the world must be highly con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alized , and it &apos;s not relevant to have it on regi@@ onal level . we must be much more deta@@ iled .
and that &apos;s a quite clever guy , hu@@ h ?
but it slightly bor@@ es me .
so i had a really quite happy life at indi@@ ana .
and certainly , nei@@ ther cri@@ ck or i were chemi@@ sts , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , fran@@ c@@ is knew wil@@ kins .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was cra@@ p .
and we knew we were right .
but that &apos;s the only -- no , we were only photograph@@ ed twice .
so , we started with breast cancer because there &apos;s lots of money for it , no government money .
were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
you need to know that the average patent tro@@ ll defen@@ se costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
beh@@ old , patent in@@ fr@@ in@@ gement via mobile device -- defined as a computer which is not sta@@ tion@@ ary .
it was a huge success .
they laugh@@ ed together .
now i bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven &apos;t even heard of , i &apos;m absolutely sure .
bru@@ ce a@@ yl@@ ward : o@@ ops . j@@ on , polio &apos;s almost been er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated .
so what we &apos;re looking for is a perman@@ ent solution .
it de@@ teri@@ or@@ ates so quickly in the tro@@ pic@@ s that we &apos;ve had to put this special v@@ acc@@ ine monit@@ or on every single vi@@ al so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s ex@@ posed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good v@@ acc@@ ine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not po@@ tent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them .
within a couple of years , every country that started polio er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation rapi@@ dly er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated all three of their polio viruses , with the ex@@ ception of four countries that you see here .
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and si@@ sters .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio v@@ acc@@ ine that tar@@ ge@@ ted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
it &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
and she took us on a journey and reve@@ aled something very special to us -- her own daughter , eight days old .
d@@ j : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cat@@ s hate water , and so this was a real re@@ vel@@ ation for us .
b@@ j : so , as der@@ e@@ ck says , we have to work through extre@@ mes -- extreme temper@@ atures , push ourselves at night .
it was phenomen@@ al , and we felt gr@@ ate@@ ful that she tru@@ sted us to that ex@@ tent .
but i have to tell you -- everybody always as@@ ks , &quot; what happened to the baby bab@@ o@@ on ? &quot;
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today .
my ti@@ tle : &quot; que@@ erer than we can suppose : the stran@@ gen@@ ess of science . &quot;
science has taught us , against all intuition , that appar@@ ently soli@@ d things , like cr@@ y@@ st@@ als and ro@@ cks , are really almost entirely com@@ posed of empty space .
if we &apos;d evolved in a vac@@ u@@ um , we would expect them to hit the ground simul@@ tane@@ ously . if we were bacteria , constantly bu@@ ff@@ et@@ ed by ther@@ mal mov@@ ements of molecules , it would be different , but we middle worl@@ ders are too big to notice brow@@ ni@@ an motion .
what we see of the real world is not the un@@ var@@ nis@@ hed world but a model of the world , regul@@ ated and ad@@ ju@@ sted by sense data , but constru@@ cted so it &apos;s useful for dealing with the real world .
mira@@ cles are just events that are extremely im@@ prob@@ able .
we &apos;d be different , our characters would be different , if our neuro@@ -@@ an@@ atom@@ y and our physi@@ ological chemistry were different .
i went to not@@ re d@@ ame university and gradu@@ ated with degrees in accoun@@ ting and ger@@ man , including spending a year of study in au@@ stri@@ a .
all of us have dis@@ abilities in one form or another .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentle@@ man called h@@ ans jen@@ ny in the 197@@ 0s .
then on the right we can see a cy@@ matically created s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of con@@ science , change became not only possible , but inevi@@ table .
and it &apos;s terri@@ bly en@@ danger@@ ed .
and you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very hea@@ vi@@ ly brazi@@ li@@ an space .
it &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long di@@ stances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
you start looking at how the global plane fli@@ ghts move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
when you look at the new york times , you look at other eli@@ te media , what you lar@@ gely get are pictures of very weal@@ thy nations and the nations we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
there &apos;s a group right now in china called ye@@ e@@ y@@ an .
not only does she have to keep our isra@@ el@@ i and pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an contribu@@ tors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the middle east .
he knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
we have to fix our im@@ migra@@ tion policy .
in afghanistan , for example , we haven &apos;t just had one ele@@ ction or two elec@@ tions . we &apos;ve gone through three elec@@ tions , pres@@ identi@@ al and par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ary . and what do we find ?
it &apos;s not that it guar@@ an@@ te@@ es peace with itself or with its neighb@@ ors .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp r@@ ory ste@@ wart . iraq and afghanistan &apos;s new democra@@ cies are deeply cor@@ ru@@ pt ; mean@@ while , 8@@ 4 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , ste@@ wart sounds a call to action to re@@ build democracy , starting with recogni@@ zing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ide@@ al .
the short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from japan .
this is a bil@@ l@@ board that says : &quot; wel@@ come to the birth@@ place of general t@@ so . &quot;
let &apos;s go back to mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s when the chinese first came to america .
for example , there is french chinese food , where they serve s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er fro@@ g legs .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diam@@ ond , or , you know , diag@@ onal .
so me , general t@@ so &apos;s chicken and this lo@@ go are all kar@@ ma@@ cally related .
finally , in about the six@@ te@@ ent@@ h century , a physi@@ cian whose name was the@@ op@@ h@@ ra@@ st@@ us bom@@ ba@@ st@@ us au@@ re@@ ol@@ us von ho@@ hen@@ heim , called par@@ ac@@ el@@ su@@ s , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old par@@ ac@@ el@@ su@@ s found that he could predict the degree of con@@ vul@@ sion by using a measu@@ red amount of cam@@ ph@@ or to produce the con@@ vul@@ sion .
he rel@@ ap@@ sed a little bit , they gave him a series of treat@@ ments , and he was essentially cu@@ red .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and they tried everything they had .
well , he said , &quot; can &apos;t we try a course of electro@@ sho@@ ck therapy ? &quot;
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was dis@@ char@@ ged from that hospital , and i jo@@ ined a group of surge@@ ons where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frank@@ ly , sel@@ fis@@ h@@ ly -- un@@ bur@@ den myself and let it be known that this is not an un@@ trou@@ bled mind that has written all of these books .
i believe the concept of global citi@@ zen@@ ship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across contin@@ ents .
now , what is remarkable is that civil rights in america were achie@@ ved in the 196@@ 0s .
but i think this is the fru@@ stration that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you &apos;re talking about .
and we have had a speak@@ er who said that very thing , and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed a s@@ word right after that , which was quite dra@@ matic .
i mean , the great diffic@@ ul@@ ty in europe is if you &apos;re at a meeting and 27 people speak , it takes a very very long time .
and then the secre@@ t@@ ary general of the united nations &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
so the question is , how do you rein@@ vent something that has been around for five mil@@ len@@ nia ?
and the most remarkable fe@@ at is that my hand actually sta@@ yed still long enough to do that .
and you see here a picture of a tissue section .
some of the greatest innova@@ tions and develop@@ ments in the world often happen at the inter@@ section of two fields .
if you don &apos;t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
data : a couple of new jer@@ sey h@@ unter@@ s are out in the wo@@ ods .
so this is actually the first time we &apos;ve ever done live audience feedback to a performance .
what can we do together that benefits us both ?
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that c@@ ali@@ bra@@ tion of clo@@ sen@@ ess and distance that en@@ ables me to find the people that i need right now , that en@@ ables me to find the sources of inti@@ ma@@ cy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself thr@@ ust into a for@@ ged docum@@ ents work@@ shop .
i was born in al@@ geria .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
but it was only the beginning .
he also expla@@ ined to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
europe was not spar@@ ed either .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a shar@@ p dec@@ line of ecosystem fun@@ ctions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regu@@ late climate on the long term , in our fore@@ sts , land and bio@@ diversity .
as a si@@ del@@ ine , you know that the only red fla@@ g that po@@ pped up here was a sub@@ marine from an un@@ named country that plan@@ ted a red fla@@ g at the bottom of the arc@@ tic to be able to control the oil resources .
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quanti@@ fied boundar@@ ies , as suggest@@ ed by this analysis .
under the reali@@ zation from tour@@ ist oper@@ ators , fis@@ her@@ men , the austr@@ ali@@ an great bar@@ rier re@@ e@@ f auth@@ ority and scientists that the great bar@@ rier re@@ e@@ f is do@@ om@@ ed under the current govern@@ ance regi@@ me .
the key though in all of these , the red thre@@ ad , is the shift in min@@ d@@ set , moving away from a situation where we simply are pus@@ hing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead back@@ cast our future , and we say , &quot; what is the playing field on the planet ?
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
but i wasn &apos;t into selling wh@@ is@@ key ; i was into selling ice .
&quot; the sna@@ il . &quot;
this is &quot; 6@@ ,@@ 500 y@@ ards , &quot; after cor@@ ot . &quot; 9@@ ,000 y@@ ards , &quot; after ger@@ hard ri@@ chter .
they do a dna scan of this , they will come up with a great ma@@ il@@ ing list .
a han@@ ger .
and we can then see the result of such mu@@ tations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
and later , between 100 and 5@@ 0,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to col@@ oni@@ ze the rest of the world .
there is another thing with those tra@@ its that we so easily obser@@ ve in each other that i think is wor@@ th@@ while to consider , and that is that , in a very liter@@ al sense , they &apos;re really on the surface of our bodies .
statisti@@ cally speaking , there is no difference in how often the ne@@ anderth@@ al mat@@ ches one african or the other .
they meet ne@@ anderth@@ als , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in sou@@ the@@ ast asia , they meet den@@ iso@@ v@@ ans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
so sustain@@ ability is quite important for us , which should in@@ corpo@@ rate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
so let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
we have social areas inside the air@@ craft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
these are survival skills .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is medi@@ ated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
there are millions of individuals with autis@@ m all around us .
well , it &apos;s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basically step inside a body .
it &apos;s almost as if that stimul@@ us , you , you &apos;re not exer@@ ting influence on what happens as they navi@@ gate their daily lives .
early diagno@@ sis of autis@@ m spectrum dis@@ order can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . at tedx@@ pe@@ ach@@ tree , ami kli@@ n descri@@ bes a new early dete@@ ction method that uses e@@ ye@@ -@@ tracking technologies to g@@ auge babies &apos; social engagement skills and reli@@ ably measure their risk of developing autis@@ m . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if you &apos;re an out@@ board person@@ nel , now you stand up .
you are going to hit the ground .
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e@@ . lee , john bu@@ ford at ge@@ tt@@ y@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
i asked , &quot; where were you on 9 / 11 ? &quot;
i learned they are the sin@@ e@@ w which hold the force together .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
she then as@@ sig@@ ned these works ra@@ cial identi@@ ties , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob col@@ es@@ c@@ ot@@ t , afri@@ can@@ -@@ american artist ; le@@ on gol@@ u@@ b , a white artist .
what that might mean for cultural mov@@ ements all over this moment , the &quot; me , we &quot; seems incredibly pres@@ cient totally important .
so , what do i discover when i look at art@@ works ?
they down@@ lo@@ aded it from dis@@ ne@@ y@@ .com , or one of these web@@ sites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
i called in 26 children .
but 30 percent is not a pass .
i gave them six g@@ c@@ se questions .
you can &apos;t catch me .
they typ@@ ed it into google , transl@@ ated it into itali@@ an , went back into itali@@ an google .
&#91; &quot; o@@ edi@@ pus re@@ x &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; the li@@ on king &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; ti@@ tus &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; fri@@ da &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; the magic fl@@ ute &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; across the universe &quot; &#93; j@@ ul@@ ie ta@@ y@@ mor : thank you . thank you very much .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappe@@ ared into the sha@@ do@@ ws , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ tern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
i love the appar@@ ent truth of theater .
ar@@ iel : i bo@@ ar@@ ded the king &apos;s ship . in every cab@@ in , i fl@@ am@@ ed ama@@ z@@ ement .
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two sta@@ ge@@ hands all in black with wat@@ ering cans ran along the top and started to po@@ ur water on the sand ca@@ st@@ le , and the sand ca@@ st@@ le started to dri@@ p and sin@@ k , but before it did , the audience saw the black@@ -@@ cla@@ d sta@@ ge@@ hands .
what the hell are we doing up there on that stage ?
j@@ ul@@ ie ta@@ y@@ mor : spi@@ der@@ -@@ man , the li@@ on king and life on the creative edge
you choose . it &apos;s your bak@@ ery , your street , your country -- not mine . &quot;
and so , on a mi@@ cr@@ o level , there &apos;s a real role for this combin@@ ation of investment and phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotion@@ ally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from pro@@ ving that the product they produced was at the worl@@ d-@@ quality level needed to make co@@ ar@@ tem , when they were in the biggest c@@ ash crisis of their history .
in our first year , the first net went off the line in oc@@ tober of 2003 .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the se@@ wing machines .
now , when we first started talking to ok go -- the name of the song is &quot; this too shall pass &quot; -- we were really excited because they expres@@ sed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
the machine itself would start the music .
it doesn &apos;t matter what temperature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
and now to introdu@@ ce their music video , we have ok go .
and so we built some very sophisti@@ cated radio anten@@ n@@ as just for prob@@ ing both walls and se@@ arch@@ ing for an air gap .
so we thought of an aug@@ mented reality app@@ lic@@ ation using a tab@@ let . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
and the later it fa@@ ils , the worse the consequences .
it &apos;s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
i &apos;ve tried to show in this -- though the color doesn &apos;t come out -- that what i &apos;m concerned with is the little 5@@ 0-@@ year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future -- your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 5@@ 0-@@ year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population cur@@ ve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than dou@@ bles and we &apos;re up three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be ad@@ ded than exi@@ sted on earth when i was born .
your great@@ -@@ great grand@@ parents got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there &apos;s this huge power that &apos;s essential for our lifest@@ yle . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : conser@@ ve , recy@@ cle , etc .
it &apos;s part of a long-term program nasa spon@@ sor@@ ed .
all right .
well , inspired by the sent@@ ences , i decided to wi@@ el@@ d the pain@@ t@@ br@@ ush .
thank you .
&quot; it &apos;d be like putting a piece of to@@ ast through a bas@@ ket@@ ball ho@@ op , wouldn &apos;t it ? &quot;
over thousands of years ago , he pro@@ ved that for us .
he pro@@ ved it was prime with nothing more than a qu@@ ill , ink , paper and his mind .
it took him , by his esti@@ mate , &quot; three years of sun@@ days . &quot;
it &apos;s because of cur@@ tis co@@ op@@ er that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 5@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,@@ 16@@ 1 .
we live in an age where some of the great break@@ through@@ s are not going to happen in the lab@@ s or the hall@@ s of acade@@ mi@@ a but on laptops , des@@ k@@ tops , in the pal@@ ms of people &apos;s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
and what was so gor@@ ge@@ ous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter hig@@ gs and his team considered one of the deep@@ est of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
in fact , growing up in tas@@ man@@ ia , it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil in the wild .
scientists around the world were intri@@ gu@@ ed by this cancer , this infe@@ c@@ tious cancer , that was spre@@ ading through the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil population .
he &apos;s a tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil that we found with a large tumor on his face .
he &apos;s a dog that bel@@ on@@ gs to a family in mom@@ bas@@ a in kenya .
however , under some circum@@ stances , it can happen .
so if we &apos;re married , we &apos;re more likely to have kids .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
number two : re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the out@@ come , the p@@ ure act of anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion makes us happy .
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
but if someone started off saying , &quot; my average li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent , &quot; and we said , &quot; hey , bad news .
and what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s pas@@ sing a small magnetic pul@@ se through the sk@@ ul@@ l of the partici@@ p@@ ant in our study into their in@@ fer@@ ior fron@@ tal gy@@ rus .
and i believe there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
it really should be called the re@@ co@@ very or return of asia .
but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concep@@ ts .
the te@@ c@@ ton@@ ic pl@@ ates of world politics were shif@@ ting .
you know , it looks at economic power measu@@ red by g@@ dp .
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
now i don &apos;t mean to be po@@ ll@@ y@@ an@@ na@@ ish about this .
in fact , they &apos;ve accoun@@ ted for half of all civil wars .
and why is it so difficult ini@@ tially ?
so the don@@ ors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navi@@ gate by needs you get a very un@@ focused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to imple@@ ment change is very limited .
there &apos;s one sector which isn &apos;t ex@@ posed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sensi@@ ble sector to exp@@ and , post-@@ conflict , and that is the construction sector .
the planning function and policy function sta@@ ys with the mini@@ stry ; the deli@@ very of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- chur@@ ches , n@@ gos , local communities , whatever works .
what &apos;s the goal ?
there are important distribu@@ tional consequences , and they &apos;re not what you always might think .
we need better planning and systems for ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation .
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without wor@@ rying about creating noise or avo@@ i@@ ding t@@ all buildings .
there are no quick fi@@ xes .
t : most importantly ... s : most importantly ...
j@@ w : so is english man@@ ia good or bad ?
now this has raised all sorts of questions .
and he asked that particular person , what do cro@@ ws and fish have in common ?
they weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of americans practic@@ ed professi@@ ons that were cogni@@ tively dem@@ and@@ ing .
now over the last century , in developed nations like america , moral debate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hypo@@ the@@ tical seriously , and we also take univer@@ s@@ als seriously and look for logi@@ cal connections .
you have to say , well , black@@ ness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that .
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophisti@@ cation of the modern world is through politics , and sa@@ dly you can have human@@ e moral principles , you can classi@@ fy , you can use lo@@ gic on abstra@@ ctions , and if you &apos;re ignor@@ ant of history and of other countries , you can &apos;t do politics .
i &apos;m a public school teacher , and i just want to share a story of my super@@ inten@@ dent .
it could have been den@@ ti@@ stry , but the word &quot; experiment@@ al &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what i had to go for .
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ stam@@ ent to teaching and teachers .
and so that gest@@ ure of my mother &apos;s continu@@ es through many generations .
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cab@@ in@@ et .
see , mr. h@@ unter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
this is about my friend brenn@@ an .
he r@@ ings the bell again . he says , &quot; we have &quot; -- and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock -- &quot; we have , all nations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together .
in india , we had the na@@ x@@ ali@@ te movement , the &#91; un@@ clear &#93; movement .
when you pu@@ mp in air in a bi@@ cycle , you use a bit of this .
they always make a tri@@ ang@@ ular roof .
now this is a little pu@@ mp with which you could inf@@ late a ballo@@ on .
but this is great fun for children .
i just put this inside this .
they are f@@ used together , so you can &apos;t separate them .
there are no pat@@ ents . anyone can make it .
this is called &quot; the cap@@ tain &apos;s hat story . &quot;
and the ship sin@@ ks , and the cap@@ tain has lost everything , but for a life jac@@ ket .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explor@@ ed these ideas .
the way we tend to use resources is we extra@@ ct them , we turn them into shor@@ t-@@ life products and then dis@@ pose of them .
and we &apos;d also have a coffee shop , and the waste gra@@ ins from that could be used as a sub@@ strate for growing mush@@ rooms .
so amazing example of an adap@@ tation to a very resour@@ ce-@@ con@@ stra@@ ined environment -- and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we &apos;re going to be facing over the next few years , next few decades .
so this is how this sche@@ me would look .
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
and if i want to start having children by the time i &apos;m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
now , there was one small catch .
and they say to me , &quot; stop com@@ pla@@ ining . &quot;
for me , the ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es that i have are really just new work projects that i &apos;ve launched .
she said she is &quot; sil@@ ly , nice and friend@@ ly . &quot;
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that i speak flu@@ ent japanese and i know ja@@ vas@@ cri@@ pt and i was okay with that .
obviously , i &apos;m having a fab@@ ul@@ ous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
imagine you &apos;re driving in a fo@@ g . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avo@@ i@@ ding the accident , or getting into an accident .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &apos;ve for@@ gotten their co@@ at .
that &apos;s a multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ tas@@ ker .
so let me illu@@ strate that step with a task which is called mental ro@@ tation .
da@@ ph@@ ne ba@@ ve@@ li@@ er : your brain on video games
you get something a little bit more complicated .
well , this has deep impli@@ cations about the limit@@ s of science , about predic@@ t@@ ability and controll@@ ability of things like biological processes or econom@@ ies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology .
so let &apos;s try asking a question , like a health related question .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleas@@ ed with it all .
then , the idea is that wol@@ fra@@ m al@@ ph@@ a will be able to figure out what pre@@ cise pieces of code can do what they &apos;re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , pre@@ cise programs .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , beha@@ ves like continu@@ ous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can be@@ have like a continu@@ ous flu@@ id .
that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
there are very few doctors and , quite frank@@ ly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cop@@ e with such epide@@ mi@@ cs .
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times che@@ aper than the current op@@ tions .
it &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she constantly remin@@ ded me and my si@@ bl@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do .
this should have been given to a boy . we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
i learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
and we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . thank you very much .
it took us 50 years to reach an@@ nu@@ al sav@@ ings rat@@ ings of almost 10 percent . 50 years .
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
we &apos;re going to go through four valu@@ e-@@ shif@@ ts that we see driving new consumer behaviors , that offer new management principles .
another quick example of these types of mov@@ ements is the rise of zy@@ n@@ ga .
but they also talk about the fact that their ex@@ ecu@@ tives , all of their expen@@ se repor@@ ts are put onto their company in@@ tran@@ et for everyone to see .
another great example is fi@@ deli@@ ty .
the traditional thing would be to bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t right ?
it &apos;s been tremend@@ ously powerful for consum@@ ers .
i know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
in fact , i grew up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood .
we tend to form clu@@ sters based on simil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produce stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about other clu@@ sters of people .
i ski@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of becoming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an ac@@ qui@@ red language .
many auth@@ ors feel this pressure , but non-@@ western auth@@ ors feel it more hea@@ vi@@ ly .
but there were times when i wanted to re@@ mind both sides that this was fi@@ ction .
books have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that i was -- that i once was .
au@@ d@@ re l@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; the white fa@@ thers taught us to say , &apos; i think , therefore i am . &apos; &quot; she suggest@@ ed , &quot; i feel , therefore i am free . &quot;
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
now , american copy@@ right and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
that is all there is to it . apple has pat@@ ented this .
he recor@@ ds a song called &quot; blind will@@ ie mc@@ tell , &quot; named after the blu@@ es sing@@ er , and the song is a vo@@ y@@ age through the past , through a much dar@@ ker time , but a simpl@@ er one , a time when musi@@ cians like will@@ ie mc@@ tell had few illu@@ sions about what they did .
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
and one of the first vic@@ ti@@ ms of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curi@@ o@@ si@@ t@@ y-@@ led science and exploration .
it &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diam@@ e@@ ter .
so below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
well , this looks like a picture of virtu@@ ally nothing .
and one of the ast@@ on@@ ishing predic@@ tions of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that descri@@ bes transi@@ stors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reach@@ ed the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.@@ 4 times the mass of the sun .
it was made in stars like that , lo@@ cked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in explo@@ sions like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
but it vis@@ ited ju@@ pit@@ er , saturn , ur@@ an@@ us and ne@@ p@@ tun@@ e .
thank you .
the red dots you see up there are sites that are behavi@@ oral tracking that i have not navi@@ g@@ ated to , but are following me .
pretty simple -- it &apos;s huge business .
thank you for being here .
you &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot;
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything .
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
my dad said , &quot; that &apos;s one , &quot; and i still didn &apos;t let that go .
i was walking through el dor@@ a@@ do -- it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or in@@ famous prison -- in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , and i don &apos;t know what pos@@ s@@ essed me , because this was not like me .
but i know i needed to .
but even as a child , i could feel the hea@@ v@@ iness in their he@@ arts .
hope kept me alive .
my father tried very hard to motiv@@ ate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
in north korea , i made it myself .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the exp@@ o was environmental issues .
that &apos;s the responsibility of architec@@ ts .
i started com@@ mu@@ ting to ko@@ be , and i met the society of viet@@ nam@@ ese people .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
i used the shi@@ pping contain@@ er and also the students helped us to make all the building fur@@ ni@@ ture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
and those two ro@@ les came together for me in a book that i wrote called &quot; orig@@ ins . &quot;
now why would this kind of fe@@ tal learning be useful ?
and often it does something more .
when food is sc@@ ar@@ ce , they diver@@ t nutri@@ ents towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and li@@ ver .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about p@@ ts@@ d .
mt : this faith in the fic@@ tional is essential for any kind of the@@ at@@ ri@@ cal experience .
the audience is led to make assu@@ mp@@ tions or el@@ abor@@ ations that are perfectly reas@@ on@@ able , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us s@@ mile .
so what i &apos;m asking for is the creation of a new job ti@@ tle -- i &apos;ll come to this a little later -- and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .
but i was at a ted event recently and es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
one of them also being , although logi@@ cally it &apos;s quite a good idea to have a li@@ ft with no up and down butt@@ on in it , if it only ser@@ ves two flo@@ ors , it &apos;s actually b@@ loo@@ dy terri@@ fying , okay ?
because , if the board of direc@@ tors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely depen@@ dent on the decisions made by the board of direc@@ tors , it makes the dis@@ par@@ ity in sal@@ aries slightly more justi@@ fi@@ able than if you actually ac@@ knowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company &apos;s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tac@@ tical activity .
so the first thing i &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
i become the medium through which the music is being chan@@ nel@@ ed , and in the process , when all is right , the music is trans@@ formed and so am i .
because this is about 10 dollars of addi@@ tional hard@@ ware if you already have a n@@ inten@@ do wi@@ i .
but i also learned very soon there@@ after that jes@@ us also said , and i &apos;m par@@ ap@@ hr@@ asing , the poor would always be with us .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genu@@ ine place of hope and exc@@ it@@ ement to help and of gener@@ osity .
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entreprene@@ urs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
i just got this impres@@ sion that the money would work .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so with that in mind , this particular inci@@ dent has led to the things that i &apos;m working on now .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on now .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
the universe can spon@@ tane@@ ously create itself out of nothing .
but we are enter@@ ing an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
i &apos;m a designer and an educ@@ ator .
in other words , i look for ali@@ ens , and when i tell people that at a cock@@ tail party , they usually look at me with a mil@@ dly incre@@ dul@@ ous look on their face .
that &apos;s a degree of an impro@@ vement that would look good on your report card , okay ?
so that &apos;s not so bad . i mean , even with two do@@ zen years , you open up your brow@@ ser and there &apos;s news of a signal , or you get a c@@ up of coffee .
it would change his day , all right ?
these sorts of ideas don &apos;t really have any v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty , that you can &apos;t trust the scientists .
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a ho@@ ok to science , because se@@ ti invol@@ ves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronom@@ y , but also ge@@ ology , also chemistry , various scientific discipl@@ ines all can be pres@@ ented in the gu@@ ise of , &quot; we &apos;re looking for e@@ .@@ t@@ . &quot;
let me just say , look , my job is a privi@@ lege because we &apos;re in a special time .
after i was invited by ted , i did some dig@@ ging , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my ho@@ st .
you find eleph@@ ants , r@@ hin@@ os , mon@@ keys , pig@@ s , etc .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3@@ .@@ 3 million years , but the labor was very long .
what do we actually know about our ancestors ?
what does that tell us ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s important to pro@@ mote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
for example , g@@ arb@@ age dis@@ charge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regul@@ ating ship dis@@ charge of g@@ arb@@ age actually get we@@ ak@@ er the further you are from sh@@ ore .
but the sar@@ gas@@ so sea , the same way it ag@@ gre@@ gates sar@@ gas@@ sum we@@ ed , actually is pul@@ ling in the plastic from throughout the region .
getting closer to sh@@ ore , where we are , this was in fact taken in the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
kri@@ st@@ ina g@@ j@@ erde : making law on the high se@@ as
and it &apos;s focus . nor@@ man je@@ wi@@ son said to me , &quot; i think it all has to do with foc@@ using yourself on one thing . &quot;
why do people succe@@ ed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? nei@@ ther . analy@@ st richard st@@ . john con@@ den@@ ses years of intervie@@ ws into an un@@ miss@@ able 3@@ -@@ minute sli@@ des@@ how on the real secre@@ ts of success .
death : go to i@@ fi@@ die@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
and this man , arch@@ ie co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e , is a pris@@ on@@ er of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
he very carefully and me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously notes his results in an exercise book .
and you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
i realize that &apos;s an ambi@@ gu@@ ous stat@@ ement .
even this problem , too complicated .
it didn &apos;t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
it &apos;s so un@@ comfortable .
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have rob@@ ust results ? &quot;
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
it will stop because of the end of trade resources .
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of b@@ end the rules of physics to suit our needs .
i accept where we are .
imagine our hig@@ hl@@ y-@@ tun@@ ed , ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time food industry and our hig@@ hl@@ y-@@ st@@ ressed agri@@ cultural system fail@@ ing and super@@ market shel@@ ves emp@@ t@@ ying .
think about war .
we need to act like the future depen@@ ds on it .
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ulti@@ mate re@@ boot looks like .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these deb@@ ts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
everything else is mand@@ ated .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
and all we &apos;ve got is a ro@@ om@@ ba .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &apos;ll be able to hear maybe how bat@@ s sing , or how wh@@ ales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of ton@@ al sc@@ ales .
i think we &apos;re going to move from a homo sa@@ pi@@ ens into a homo evol@@ u@@ tis .
and the people thought , &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
and so if we look at recent cr@@ as@@ hes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years &apos; worth of data -- you won &apos;t see it in the recent cr@@ as@@ hes . the new car se@@ ats are far , far better . &quot;
so , let me show you what happens .
that &apos;s some more evidence , so in some sense -- i was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed by a scientist , who said , &quot; you could never publi@@ sh a study with an n of 4 , &quot; meaning those four cr@@ as@@ hes .
and it turned out that most people wouldn &apos;t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he &apos;d come back . and my dad had a third j@@ ar of p@@ ills .
it &apos;s in 5,000 days , all this stuff has come .
so , i was trying to basically make measu@@ re@@ ments .
so by the year 20@@ 40 , the total process@@ ing of this machine will ex@@ ce@@ ed a total process@@ ing power of humanity , in ra@@ w bits and stuff . and this is , i think , where ray kurz@@ weil and others get this little ch@@ art saying that we &apos;re going to cross .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do spre@@ ad@@ she@@ ets and things at work , a word docum@@ ent , they aren &apos;t on the web , but they are going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
m@@ clu@@ han was saying , &quot; machines are the exten@@ sions of the human senses . &quot;
so every idea is basically being suppor@@ ted -- or every it@@ em , or every n@@ ou@@ n -- is being suppor@@ ted by the entire web .
so we have this dat@@ ab@@ ase of things .
but it &apos;ll anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te what we &apos;re doing , in a good sense .
my journey to coming here today started in 197@@ 4 .
and so i decided to write a book , a me@@ mo@@ ir , about this decade of my life .
all i have to do is hum@@ bly follow .
and i organi@@ ze it . and , well , it &apos;s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company finally is a negoti@@ ation between one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s concep@@ tual world , the world of ideas , the world of as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , of inven@@ tions , with the relationship of the ex@@ teri@@ or world and all the limit@@ ations , the na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , obser@@ ving every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then plac@@ ing that within this .
and then the bro@@ a@@ der ideas of c@@ it@@ y-@@ making start having direct influ@@ ences on architecture , on the elements that make up the bro@@ a@@ der sche@@ me , the buildings themselves , and start gui@@ ding us .
it &apos;s transpar@@ ent , and it allows you to understand , i think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual con@@ struc@@ tional processes that make it .
we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground .
they have 22 satelli@@ tes zi@@ pping around at plus or min@@ us 100 miles , and the site &apos;s in red .
well , then we get to this image .
please , also on the bal@@ con@@ y .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
you can continue to inno@@ v@@ ate and inv@@ ent .
this is what we are using . &quot;
it &apos;s this brain which makes this refle@@ x .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sa@@ ti@@ ation .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
10,000 square kilometers , tens of thousands of is@@ lands fl@@ ung like je@@ wel@@ s upon the southern sea .
the third no@@ ble truth said that ignor@@ ance can be over@@ come .
and then you do the ritual dan@@ ces that em@@ power the cros@@ ses .
they consu@@ me more co@@ ca leaves than any human population , half a po@@ und per man , per day .
this little boy will never step outside of the sac@@ red fields that surro@@ und the men &apos;s hu@@ t for all that time , until he begins his journey of initi@@ ation .
so , their entire year has been cut in half .
anthropo@@ log@@ ist wa@@ de da@@ v@@ is mus@@ es on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares brea@@ th@@ taking photos and stories of the el@@ der brothers , a group of si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada indi@@ ans whose spi@@ ritual practice hol@@ ds the world in balance .
today , we use a single feed@@ stock , pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
the first is sel@@ ec@@ ting a feed@@ stock , pre@@ fer@@ ably something that &apos;s regi@@ onal , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufacturing .
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days .
good after@@ noon .
now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature ris@@ es by even a fra@@ ction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
but what seems so slow and gra@@ ce@@ ful from the outside is really more like chaos inside , because cells control their shape with a skelet@@ on of ri@@ gi@@ d protein fi@@ bers , and those fi@@ bers are constantly fall@@ ing apart .
as a test case , i pro@@ pose we start with american dan@@ cers .
when they say to you , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; i &apos;m a statisti@@ cian . &quot;
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
so what you want to do is compare the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head with the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ tail .
if it &apos;s a tail -- well , rather dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted@@ ly , you put the glas@@ ses away and put the cham@@ pagne back .
but it turns out that un@@ lo@@ cking the secre@@ ts in the information gener@@ ated by modern experiment@@ al technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisti@@ cated -- you &apos;ll be re@@ lie@@ ved to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisti@@ cated than the head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head story -- but quite sophisti@@ cated computer mod@@ el@@ ings and mathematical mod@@ el@@ ings and modern statisti@@ cal techniques .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
one explan@@ ation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is un@@ likely .
it might well be that there are environmental fac@@ tors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic fac@@ tors we &apos;re not aware of .
it has to do with wei@@ gh@@ ing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statisti@@ cal evidence .
that &apos;s what engineers do . &quot;
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this .
there are 10 billion electrical out@@ lets in north america alone .
and now , today i want to tell you my personal obser@@ vation in the past several years , from that wall .
on the one hand , he wants to satis@@ fy people &apos;s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social net@@ working .
and later this year , the ra@@ il minister was sac@@ ked and sent@@ enced to ja@@ il for 10 years .
at the comm@@ enting area , &#91; it makes &#93; the chinese weib@@ o more like facebook , rather than the original twitter .
for example , you can &apos;t post the name of the president , h@@ u j@@ in@@ ta@@ o , and also you can &apos;t post the city of ch@@ on@@ g@@ q@@ ing , the name , and until recently , you can &apos;t search the sur@@ name of top leaders .
so they want an exc@@ use -- public opini@@ on is a very good exc@@ use to pun@@ ish him .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; c@@ at &#93; .
it &apos;s ac@@ ou@@ stic vi@@ bra@@ tions in the air , little waves of energy in the air that ti@@ ck@@ le our ear@@ dr@@ um .
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .
girl : hol@@ ly .
so if we had to design a perfect co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music trans@@ mission .
co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant users cannot tell the difference between these instru@@ ments .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music rema@@ ins .
he is now a medical student at y@@ ale university , and he &apos;s con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating a sur@@ gical career -- one of the first dea@@ f individuals to consider a career in surgery .
when i look around this tedx@@ am@@ ster@@ dam venue , i see a very special audience .
g@@ uns are not a part of our lives .
when he a@@ im@@ ed , he never mis@@ sed .
despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer common@@ place .
the ar@@ med forces imple@@ ment the state mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly on violence .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldi@@ er with this gun .
and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three-@@ dimensional fol@@ ding .
we want to be able to build technologi@@ cal arti@@ facts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological arti@@ facts , like people and wh@@ ales and trees .
and then what happens ?
women are much more in balance because they don &apos;t have that idea that they &apos;re going to be able to do 100 pul@@ l-@@ u@@ ps .
but we do have the potential to over@@ come disease and poverty , and i &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples of how per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve this phenomen@@ a is .
there &apos;s a basic , profound acceler@@ ation of this evolutionary process .
i mean , you &apos;d think this is the result of some tab@@ le@@ top experiment , but this is the result of worldwide cha@@ o@@ tic behavior -- countries acc@@ using each other of du@@ mp@@ ing products , ipo@@ s , bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies , marketing programs .
we &apos;re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
these are some designs from eric dre@@ x@@ ler &apos;s book -- which we &apos;re now showing are fe@@ asi@@ ble with super@@ -@@ computing simu@@ lations , where actually there are scientists building mole@@ cu@@ le-@@ scale robots .
dou@@ g ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter wonder@@ s , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smar@@ ter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .
computers will com@@ bine the sub@@ tle pan@@ -@@ recogni@@ tion power@@ s of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already super@@ ior , in terms of doing analy@@ tic thinking , remem@@ ber@@ ing billions of facts ac@@ cur@@ ately .
inv@@ ent@@ or , entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r and visi@@ on@@ ary ray kurz@@ weil explains in ab@@ und@@ ant , gro@@ unded detail why , by the 20@@ 20@@ s , we will have rever@@ se-@@ engine@@ ered the human brain and nan@@ ob@@ ots will be operating your consciousness .
so like fo@@ x mul@@ der on &quot; x-@@ fil@@ es , &quot; who wants to believe in u@@ fo@@ s ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , alle@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing .
an increase of dop@@ am@@ ine caused subje@@ cts to see more patterns than those that did not recei@@ ve the dop@@ am@@ ine .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
well here &apos;s the late , great jer@@ ry and@@ rus &apos; &quot; impossible cra@@ te &quot; illusion in 3d , in which jer@@ ry is standing inside the impossible cra@@ te .
especially when they &apos;re up@@ side down , you &apos;re eng@@ aging that general fac@@ ial recogni@@ tion software there .
some con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cies really are true .
and this is test on some li@@ p bal@@ ms that we have over here .
i love trees , and i &apos;m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful arb@@ or@@ et@@ um , and sun@@ days , usually , i &apos;d go there with my wife and now , with my four@@ -year-old , and we &apos;d clim@@ b in the trees , we &apos;d play hi@@ de and se@@ ek .
but later the government soldiers began mi@@ stre@@ ating us a lot .
but this , sur@@ ely , who@@ ever that man is , whatever he &apos;s done , this is cru@@ el and unusual pun@@ ish@@ ment .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
what we &apos;re going to do now is sha@@ de the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
every now and then , when they clim@@ b on top of the ball , they wi@@ pe their face .
so this is called st@@ il@@ ting . it &apos;s a ther@@ mal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a to@@ we@@ l , somebody has this to@@ we@@ l -- &quot; sorry , i &apos;ve jum@@ ped onto your to@@ we@@ l . &quot; -- and then you sc@@ u@@ ttle across onto somebody else &apos;s to@@ we@@ l , and that way you don &apos;t burn your feet .
so here &apos;s our c@@ un@@ ning experim@@ enter .
it &apos;s about an 8@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long tube of metal , it &apos;s got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speak@@ er , and here is some lab tu@@ bing , and it &apos;s connected to this t@@ ank of pro@@ pan@@ e .
you see the sk@@ at@@ ers often trick in this direction . the ob@@ stac@@ les are easier .
sometimes you get a little star appl@@ ause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
but he was cre@@ di@@ ted with co@@ ining the phr@@ ase , &quot; because it &apos;s there . &quot;
i didn &apos;t see anyone else . we took this photo next to the heli@@ cop@@ ter .
it is , argu@@ ably , the most au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous en@@ dea@@ vor of that ed@@ war@@ di@@ an golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from sc@@ ur@@ vy to solar pan@@ els , that it was high time someone had a go at fin@@ ishing the job .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pit@@ ch is to convince them that you are the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enter@@ prise , or running something -- and it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s never been an angel@@ - or a vent@@ u@@ re-@@ fund@@ ed company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very soli@@ d , ste@@ ad@@ y , up@@ ward path , right from beginning to end .
&quot; we have no competition . there &apos;s nobody else who &apos;s ever made a wid@@ get like this . &quot;
you &apos;re foc@@ using on him ! this is steve jobs .
you do that , you give me your quick 15@@ -@@ second or 3@@ 0-@@ second in@@ tr@@ o , gra@@ b my attention .
there has never been a company that doesn &apos;t have competition .
this is that ro@@ cket going up .
number three : the hand@@ ou@@ ts you give are not your pres@@ entation .
you can use it at ted .
this is the most successful order on the planet by far .
so when i click on &quot; sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic , &quot; i get sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s .
when i click on y@@ ur@@ i g@@ ag@@ ar@@ in &apos;s page , i get this guy who was surpris@@ ingly short in stat@@ ure , huge in hero@@ ism .
by revolution , i mean a dra@@ stic and far@@ -@@ reach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have -- the way we think and the way we be@@ have .
last .
because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institu@@ tional context , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?
it &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , steve . what a du@@ m@@ b idea .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
it &apos;s not fi@@ ction , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
for example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
one , play is universal .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
un@@ accep@@ table . ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
my work actually took me through many countries , and showed me a great part of the world .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
so i was ar@@ re@@ sted quite early in stal@@ in &apos;s pur@@ ges , and spent 16 months in a russi@@ an prison .
this was bad ! man , i was -- i c@@ ough . i was sick .
idea about women .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
we really felt like what we went in expe@@ cting had nothing to do with what we were actually experi@@ en@@ cing , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affe@@ ction , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
you can &apos;t talk about how lon@@ ely having a baby can be .
and we were gr@@ ate@@ ful that i was able to get preg@@ nant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
and i got about two-@@ thir@@ ds of the way through , and there was a ch@@ art on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side -- on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand page -- that we &apos;ve lab@@ el@@ ed here &quot; the most terri@@ fying ch@@ art imag@@ in@@ able for a new par@@ ent . &quot;
a@@ v : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really res@@ u@@ b@@ mit yourself to these high@@ s and lo@@ ws -- the high@@ s being the first steps , the first s@@ mile , your child reading to you for the first time -- the lo@@ ws being , our house , any time from six to seven every night .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully hon@@ est@@ y for the sa@@ ke of hon@@ est@@ y , but a hope that by being more honest and can@@ did about these experiences , that we can all colle@@ c@@ tively b@@ end that happiness bas@@ eline up a little bit .
and , you know , it &apos;s a thing your piano teacher teach@@ es you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
and then you heard the original .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .
john q@@ . wal@@ ker : great piano performan@@ ces , re@@ created
and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
a few of these . this is a@@ ti@@ ll@@ a the hen .
we know our societies have to radi@@ cally change .
and some are quite struc@@ tural , like social impact bon@@ ds where you raise money to invest in diver@@ ting teen@@ a@@ gers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
then mon@@ arch@@ y had seen off its big challen@@ ger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-@@ inten@@ tioned but do@@ om@@ ed experiment , just as capit@@ alism has seen off soci@@ alism .
despite all of these simil@@ ari@@ ties , we see huge differences in sav@@ ings behavior .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modi@@ fy what i &apos;m saying to say , &quot; it will rain , &quot; or &quot; it &apos;s going to rain . &quot;
well , what i did with that was to access the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stics liter@@ ature .
the survey takes over a day .
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
of course , from their grand@@ parents and even their great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents .
would he need the same language as a law@@ yer , for example ?
we need one today more than ever .
they were doing an experiment to do with gene@@ tics and the for@@ eli@@ m@@ bs and the h@@ ind lim@@ bs of animals .
patri@@ ci@@ a r@@ y@@ an : don &apos;t ins@@ ist on english !
it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the de@@ bt , so for five years , six years , i only had to pay one third income ta@@ x .
and then , what population of the earth would be an equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um that could continue on , and be for 20@@ 50 , 2@@ 100 , 2@@ 150 ?
as the sky gets dar@@ ker , and the outside air temper@@ atures drop below min@@ us 100 degrees fahr@@ enheit , the most environ@@ ment@@ ally ho@@ sti@@ le se@@ gment of heli@@ os &apos;s journey has gone by without notice , except for being recor@@ ded by speci@@ ally designed data ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion systems and their associated sensor@@ s .
t@@ m : oh , 10 , 11 .
this del@@ u@@ sion is a kind of prison for us , restri@@ cting us to our personal des@@ ires and to affe@@ ction for a few person@@ s ne@@ ar@@ est to us .
and he had a l@@ um@@ p of ir@@ on .
well , at least i can clean this wo@@ und and was@@ h it . &quot;
and ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya says , &quot; i was with you . who do you think was making need@@ les and making ne@@ sts and dri@@ pping on ro@@ cks for you , mi@@ ster den@@ se ? &quot;
i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight .
the mother is the model of all al@@ tru@@ ism for human beings , in spi@@ ritual tradi@@ tions .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
and this is where you feel real compassion for them .
so , practice compassion , read the char@@ ter , dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate it and develop it within yourself .
but there &apos;s another class of simple things , which are also very important .
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
all of us , to some ex@@ tent , study this thing called a bill gates .
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of bin@@ ary , you need a device .
all right , let me then finish off with four general stat@@ ements , an example and two a@@ ph@@ or@@ is@@ ms .
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower ri@@ ght-@@ hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
but it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differ@@ enti@@ ates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual mer@@ it to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as func@@ tional as we can and as fre@@ ely inter@@ connec@@ table as we can ?
so , they got the fra@@ mes from these big bi@@ kes , put them together with the ge@@ ars from the ra@@ cing bi@@ kes , got the bra@@ kes from motor@@ cy@@ cles , and sort of mix@@ ed and mat@@ ched various ingre@@ di@@ ents .
the ideas are coming back from the consum@@ ers , and they &apos;re often ahead of the produ@@ cers .
that sounds like a w@@ inner ; we &apos;ll go with it . &quot;
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divi@@ ded into two cam@@ ps .
or the op@@ -@@ ed page , where if they knew the edi@@ tor -- had been to school with him , sle@@ pt with his wife -- they could write an article for the op@@ -@@ ed page .
and i was having dinner with this guy called ti@@ mo@@ thy ch@@ an .
if you &apos;re a games company , and you &apos;ve got a million players in your game , you only need one percent of them to be co-@@ develop@@ ers , contribu@@ ting ideas , and you &apos;ve got a development work@@ force of 10,000 people .
this was a mother &apos;s day gift .
hundreds of re@@ mix@@ es came back -- lots of different attemp@@ ts .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
recor@@ ding : okay , here &apos;s something .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m d@@ ressed as bat@@ man to hi@@ de my identity . &quot;
one person sent me a very deta@@ iled descri@@ ption ; the other person didn &apos;t .
right now , it feels like i for@@ got to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now sha@@ des of gra@@ y and it seems like the world is sp@@ inning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am sp@@ inning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the now everybody s@@ ings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the thank you .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
but then my mother said to me , &quot; i hear you &apos;ve been going around talking about psychop@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers .
but our grand@@ kids are going to be kind of concerned here .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that dete@@ ctor -- im@@ men@@ se numbers .
imagine a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h@@ 20 , water .
but what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stam@@ p collect there .
so all the ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely deta@@ iled calcu@@ lations we can do with that wonderful equ@@ ation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
so that &apos;s one thing .
in about the first billi@@ on@@ th of a second or so , the hig@@ gs field ki@@ cked in , and the quar@@ ks and the gl@@ u@@ ons and the electr@@ ons that make us up got mass .
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with im@@ men@@ se exc@@ it@@ ement to it being turned on .
so from pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a to hollywood all the way to modern art in bei@@ j@@ ing , we s@@ mile often , and you s@@ mile to express joy and satis@@ fac@@ tion .
s@@ mil@@ ing can help reduce the level of st@@ res@@ s-@@ en@@ han@@ cing hor@@ mon@@ es like cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine and dop@@ am@@ ine , increase the level of mo@@ o@@ d-@@ en@@ han@@ cing hor@@ mon@@ es like end@@ or@@ ph@@ in and reduce over@@ all blood pressure .
but i told him no , i &apos;m sorry , com@@ promise in colors is gra@@ y , and we have enough gra@@ y to last us a lifetime .
and this was not a mis@@ placed feeling .
we put the citi@@ zen first , and not the c@@ ler@@ ks .
ef@@ h@@ ari@@ st@@ o and kal@@ in@@ ih@@ ta .
people that were hun@@ gry and hur@@ ting were sign@@ aling their dist@@ ress , were sign@@ aling their need for help .
technology is transforma@@ tional .
and not only is it em@@ power@@ ing to the communities , but really importantly , this information sta@@ ys in the community where it is needed to for@@ mu@@ late long-term health poli@@ ces .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
but the story is not about these chap@@ ters .
your last job , your dinner reser@@ va@@ tions from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat pla@@ in with today &apos;s friends , because the internet also archi@@ ves , and it war@@ ps the past .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our wa@@ king moments in it , the challenge is to live in two stre@@ ams of time that are par@@ alle@@ l and almost simul@@ tane@@ ous .
i wanted to learn to co@@ ok , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cu@@ bing and ch@@ opp@@ ing for a whole month .
but if you &apos;re like me , my humanity is more like a window .
i was seven .
and then the next plan@@ ting seas@@ on , when they san@@ g the dir@@ ge , they would re@@ move as many names of the dead that equ@@ aled as many people that were born .
i cri@@ ed for a very long time .
he was obs@@ essed .
there are some of you in this room , amazing people , who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .
if you take a clo@@ se@@ -up of those , they look like this .
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extin@@ ction .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mu@@ tation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
three different op@@ tions .
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a ra@@ pid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
throughout human evolution , multiple ver@@ sions of humans co-@@ exi@@ sted . could we be mi@@ d-@@ up@@ grade now ? at tedx@@ sum@@ mit , ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z s@@ wee@@ ps across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is reve@@ aling evidence that suggests ra@@ pid evolution may be under way .
and when that happens there &apos;s moment that causes this robot to roll .
you can send them inside buildings like this as first respon@@ ders to look for in@@ tru@@ ders , maybe look for bio@@ chemical lea@@ ks , gas@@ e@@ ous lea@@ ks .
so the robot is obviously capable of ex@@ ecu@@ ting any cur@@ ve tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
so when we have a robot which is surro@@ unded by neighb@@ ors -- and let &apos;s look at robot i and robot j -- what we want the robots to do is to monit@@ or the separ@@ ation between them as they fly in forma@@ tion .
this is work done by qu@@ enti@@ n lin@@ d@@ sey who &apos;s a graduate student .
and that &apos;s how it popul@@ ates this map .
we &apos;re very co-@@ evolved , because we dep@@ end on bees for pol@@ lin@@ ation and , even more recently , as an economic com@@ modi@@ ty .
there &apos;s a counter@@ intui@@ tive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let &apos;s look at the first me@@ tri@@ c here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survival .
it &apos;s 196@@ 8 , and we &apos;re pretty much co@@ vering asia .
it &apos;s like , &quot; u@@ gh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do .
i would like to encoura@@ ge you to open your mind .
one is a super@@ market standard : white bread , pre-@@ pac@@ ka@@ ged , which i &apos;m told is called a wonder@@ bread .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few cent@@ u@@ ries , or even decades , started to cul@@ tiv@@ ate an image of a my@@ th@@ ical , rural agri@@ cultural past .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so-@@ called developing countries .
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habit@@ ats .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
but yes there are some solutions .
i want to see fish pon@@ ds in par@@ king lots and bas@@ ements .
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
living with a physical dis@@ ability isn &apos;t easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there &apos;s certain app@@ ur@@ ten@@ an@@ ces available to you that do make life easier .
it &apos;s the person that &apos;s sli@@ ding his hands up and down the le@@ vers , so the mechan@@ ism itself can be very simple and com@@ posed of bi@@ cycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achie@@ ved .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of inde@@ li@@ bly sc@@ ar your minds with these char@@ is@@ matic and ma@@ je@@ stic creatures .
and they didn &apos;t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and now the king co@@ br@@ a is a new one .
i mean , just incredible to see bun@@ ches of gh@@ ari@@ al bas@@ king on the river again .
and , you know , once a tox@@ in is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
so , people talk about political will .
r@@ w : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
and it &apos;s not a diet .
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little nai@@ ve .
and yet , look at the number of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions that are being sold .
but the problem is , you get hun@@ gry , so it &apos;s hard to keep it off .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common can@@ cers like breast , pro@@ state and col@@ on cancer .
when we looked at their p@@ sa levels -- which is a mar@@ ker for pro@@ state cancer -- they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in the experiment@@ al group , and these differences were highly significant .
it was a rand@@ om@@ i@@ zed control study published in the lan@@ c@@ et .
b@@ p : i was born old .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the hol@@ y gra@@ il of our industry .
and so , in 2004 , they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed us to do a screen test of ben@@ jam@@ in .
and we also needed to make sure that we could take bra@@ d &apos;s i@@ dio@@ syn@@ cr@@ as@@ ies , his little tics , the little sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties that make him who he is and have that trans@@ late through our process so that it appe@@ ars in ben@@ jam@@ in on the screen .
we started to look out in other fields .
this is when we &apos;re like , &quot; ok , we &apos;re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . &quot;
and because the life cast , or the b@@ ust -- the ma@@ qu@@ ette -- of ben@@ jam@@ in was made from bra@@ d , we could trans@@ pose the data of bra@@ d at 4@@ 4 onto bra@@ d at 8@@ 7 .
and then this is what we called the &quot; dead head , &quot; no re@@ ference to jer@@ ry gar@@ ci@@ a .
so , effectively we created a digital pu@@ p@@ pet that bra@@ d pit@@ t could operate with his own face .
and the bear cu@@ bs were being harv@@ est@@ ed from across the country and being sold and tra@@ ded .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
and the beautiful be@@ ars can of course live in the wild again .
we were in the desert , in wa@@ di r@@ um , in a small je@@ ep .
so as we talked , richard and i , i said , &quot; you know , maybe i should bring a cam@@ el .
but not a big -- for instance , in ze@@ br@@ as , they have a huge ear that &apos;s very mobile , so they can actually turn them both around .
you can actually see , right here , it will vi@@ bra@@ te .
well , if poor old su@@ ki is in search of a mate , what would su@@ ki do to find the perfect mate ?
i &apos;m built to last .
and i think when you look at the animal king@@ dom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
when i was po@@ et lau@@ re@@ ate , there i go again -- i can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s true -- i created a poetry chan@@ nel on del@@ ta air@@ lines that la@@ sted for a couple of years .
some days i put the people in their places at the table , b@@ end their legs at the k@@ ne@@ es , if they come with that fe@@ ature , and fix them into the tiny woo@@ den cha@@ irs .
the po@@ em that &apos;s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a dom@@ esti@@ c point of e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , process@@ ing .
i just have time to read a more recent po@@ em to you .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t ta@@ sted the fru@@ it of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of mor@@ ality would we have ?
the wol@@ f is , after all , a very co@@ oper@@ ative animal .
he takes basically everything .
and so what we do in the next step is we rele@@ ase one eleph@@ ant before the other , and that eleph@@ ant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rop@@ e -- because if he pul@@ ls at the rop@@ e , it disappe@@ ars and the whole test is over .
humans y@@ a@@ wn when others y@@ a@@ wn .
in this case , we put two chimpanze@@ es si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side .
and so we found that the chimpanze@@ es do care about the well-@@ being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
and that &apos;s what she does .
so let &apos;s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dis@@ se@@ ct some lessons from it .
so first , if you are the type , like the shir@@ t@@ less dan@@ cing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nur@@ turing your first few follo@@ wers as equ@@ als so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you .
but i decided to learn about the bi@@ ble and my her@@ it@@ age by actually di@@ ving in and trying to live it and immer@@ se myself in it .
and my imm@@ un@@ ologist told me that i should also wi@@ pe down all of the remote contro@@ ls and i@@ phones in my house , because those are just or@@ gi@@ es of ger@@ ms .
without the sex part .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
so what we found was , when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was low , people were more likely to take re@@ ven@@ ge when they &apos;re treated un@@ fairly .
but i didn &apos;t find any .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even an@@ ger , dis@@ g@@ ust and pain .
there &apos;s just one problem .
and perhaps one ar@@ che@@ ologist becomes an inst@@ ant cele@@ bri@@ ty when she disco@@ vers -- bu@@ ried in the h@@ ills somewhere in north america -- massive ver@@ sions of these same sym@@ b@@ ols .
or maybe that big ?
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these se@@ als that are very , very tiny .
now there &apos;s several thoughts . there &apos;s e@@ . it could be i@@ . it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
we found that the indu@@ s scri@@ pt actually falls within the range of the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic scri@@ p@@ ts .
that &apos;s our next big challenge .
today , we can write a word such as ted in eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an hier@@ o@@ gl@@ yp@@ hi@@ cs and in c@@ un@@ ei@@ form scri@@ pt , because both of these were deci@@ pher@@ ed in the 19@@ th century .
and this is the space probe cas@@ sin@@ i pir@@ ou@@ et@@ ting through the ice r@@ ings of saturn .
using the very first tele@@ phone , wat@@ son was in fact di@@ aled into the hea@@ v@@ ens .
a myster@@ i@@ ous per@@ si@@ stent noise was dis@@ rup@@ ting their research .
and as soon as they had la@@ id all these , all their big st@@ ack of these je@@ wel@@ ed par@@ as@@ ols that they used to carry in ancient india , he per@@ formed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planet@@ ari@@ um , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of all life in all univer@@ ses .
because that co@@ s@@ mic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s really too bor@@ ing whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
look at that beautiful thing ch@@ ih@@ o showed us . she sc@@ ared us with the la@@ va man .
this is bir@@ han , who was the ethi@@ op@@ ian girl who launched live aid in the 198@@ 0s , 15 minutes away from death when she was res@@ cu@@ ed , and that picture of her being res@@ cu@@ ed is one that went round the world .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
am@@ y win@@ e@@ house said , &quot; nel@@ son mand@@ ela and i have a lot in common .
i have just been talking to the president of si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ keeping and human@@ it@@ arian aid , but also for re@@ construction and security for some of the confli@@ c@@ t-@@ ri@@ dden states of the world .
so you go to the liter@@ ature .
the foot is distribu@@ ted along the whole leg .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
and where they have a problem with this kind of mes@@ h , because they don &apos;t have sp@@ ines .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively clim@@ bs by sli@@ pping and look -- and doing , actually , terri@@ bly , with respect to grab@@ bing on the surface .
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwi@@ ch .
we discovered they work by inter@@ molecular forces alone .
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall .
so there &apos;s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizar@@ re , wonderful animals , or you want to build a se@@ arch@@ -@@ and-@@ res@@ cu@@ e robot that can help you in an earth@@ qua@@ ke , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preser@@ ve nature &apos;s designs .
this is a cal@@ f in cap@@ tivity making an im@@ it@@ ation if you hum@@ med this tun@@ e to your dog or c@@ at and it hum@@ med it back to you , you ought to be pretty surprised .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up@@ -@@ swe@@ ep , like &quot; wo@@ op , wo@@ op , wo@@ op . &quot;
notice how few barri@@ ers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they &apos;re listening to other wh@@ ales and modi@@ fying what they sing based on what they &apos;re hearing , just like song birds or the dolph@@ in whi@@ st@@ les i described .
but you can still hear that fa@@ int call .
i &apos;ll describe a couple strategi@@ es .
en@@ danger@@ ed wh@@ ales are killed every year by ship colli@@ sion , and it &apos;s very important to try to reduce this .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
first , it en@@ ables you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescop@@ e , for me , is a kind of magic car@@ pet that lets you navi@@ gate through the universe where you want to go .
it &apos;ll be a free down@@ load -- thank you , cra@@ ig m@@ un@@ die -- and it &apos;ll be available at the website world@@ wi@@ de@@ telescop@@ e@@ .@@ or@@ g , which is something new .
it &apos;s a social aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness like you &apos;re a stran@@ ger in a foreign land .
that means they &apos;re totally out of syn@@ c in traditional clas@@ ses , which are anal@@ o@@ g , sta@@ tic , inter@@ ac@@ tively passi@@ ve .
we have so much technology no@@ wa@@ days that these inter@@ faces should start con@@ forming to us .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &apos;m really looking forward to inter@@ acting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respe@@ ctive fields .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circum@@ stances .
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ings have been recor@@ ded so far in 2010 in mexico .
with a thousand juli@@ á@@ ns working together , mexico would be a very different country .
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico -- the festi@@ v@@ als , the markets , the restaurants , the c@@ ant@@ in@@ as , the te@@ qu@@ il@@ a , the mar@@ i@@ ach@@ is , the ser@@ en@@ a@@ des , the pos@@ a@@ das , el gri@@ to , the day of the dead , san mi@@ gu@@ el , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be mexi@@ can -- doesn &apos;t disappe@@ ar from this world .
thanks . thank you . now , ju@@ g@@ gling can be a lot of fun ; play with sk@@ ill and play with space , play with rhyth@@ m .
or you can go back and change the hei@@ ght . now , sk@@ ill .
bring it back up .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
and what do you de@@ dic@@ ate it to , in explor@@ ing a particular thing ?
i app@@ ren@@ tic@@ ed with a car@@ p@@ enter and learned about pl@@ um@@ b , square and level .
and the lat@@ est thing that i &apos;m working on -- -- is something really -- i don &apos;t know what it is yet .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technologi@@ cal objects .
i have a few of them -- they &apos;re no more than a minute or a min@@ u@@ te@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half ap@@ ie@@ ce -- but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it respon@@ ds in video .
then when you ex@@ it the ima@@ x the@@ at@@ re on the fourth floor -- mostly teen@@ a@@ gers coming out of there -- there &apos;s this big open space that has these tables in it that have inter@@ active games which are quite fun , also designed by dur@@ r@@ ell &#91; bis@@ ho@@ p &#93; and andre@@ w &#91; hir@@ ni@@ ak &#93; of it@@ ch .
and of course : a ham@@ mo@@ ck for your after@@ noon na@@ p that stre@@ t@@ ches across your cu@@ bi@@ cle .
you watch the video with super@@ im@@ posed graphi@@ cs that indi@@ cate your dep@@ th and comp@@ ass head@@ ing .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
a photo is not enough . &quot;
the laws of physics : invisible , e@@ ternal , om@@ ni@@ present , all@@ -@@ powerful .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot;
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see dar@@ k@@ ness .
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about it while we are ?
this is extremely practical , but not so a@@ wes@@ ome .
so you have five million , that is , five million auth@@ ors and five million pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s is a massive law@@ suit .
two ro@@ ws from this table of two billion ent@@ ries .
and it turns out that we can measure that very pre@@ cis@@ ely .
so that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
we have to make this available for people . &quot;
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
but that &apos;s not all .
this is not tri@@ vi@@ al .
or just try this one on for size .
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that sli@@ p@@ per@@ y slo@@ pe to that dangerous , sc@@ ary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consci@@ ously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it .
and mean@@ while , i was tour@@ ing lo@@ cally and playing in ni@@ ght@@ clu@@ bs with my band , the d@@ res@@ den doll@@ s .
i &apos;ve always been with my band or my cre@@ w .
and this starts happening all the time .
this is my ki@@ ck@@ star@@ ter bac@@ ker party in ber@@ lin .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spre@@ ading , the euro@@ zone has collap@@ sed ... what else ?
actually , that photo was pa@@ sted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tra@@ cked by the police .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher recei@@ ves them , they pa@@ ste them on the school .
i do two things : i design mobile computers and i study brains .
i thought the word frame@@ work was great .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
and it &apos;s a real sh@@ ame . now why has this come about ?
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &apos;m conscious .
evolution &apos;s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bi@@ ble says , you know , god created all these species , cat@@ s are cat@@ s , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don &apos;t change .
and that somehow , predi@@ ction leads to intelligent behavior .
and in the future , when it sees something similar to that again , so in a similar environment , or the ex@@ act same environment , it &apos;ll play it back . it &apos;ll start playing it back .
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i &apos;m saying .
then , if in that frame@@ work , you take a bunch of theore@@ ti@@ cians .
no dou@@ bt that it &apos;s going to happen , in my mind .
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account -- it &apos;s not , but ...
i spoke with a@@ ung sun su@@ u k@@ y@@ i a couple of days ago .
but if they were together plan@@ ting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
today , in swe@@ den and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
but when i lec@@ ture to environ@@ ment@@ all@@ y-@@ concerned students , they tell me , &quot; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and was@@ hing machines . &quot;
second , economic growth .
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
i would like to tell you a story conne@@ cting the not@@ ori@@ ous priv@@ acy inci@@ dent invol@@ ving adam and e@@ ve , and the remarkable shift in the boundar@@ ies between public and private which has occur@@ red in the past 10 years .
do you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
dis@@ crimin@@ ation was happening through social media for equ@@ ally sk@@ ill@@ ed can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
we repe@@ ated the experiment with the same two groups , this time ad@@ ding a del@@ ay between the time we told subje@@ cts how we would use their data and the time we actually started ans@@ wer@@ ing the questions .
they become aware . they achieve autonom@@ y .
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted ken@@ ne@@ dy and dan qua@@ yle meet in the well of the sen@@ ate .
and it &apos;s led to a view of human nature that we &apos;re rational individuals who respond in stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward ways to in@@ centi@@ ves , and it &apos;s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assu@@ mp@@ tions of physics to measure how human behavior is .
they have kids of their own , and they &apos;ve achie@@ ved a genetic mira@@ cle by mar@@ rying beautiful people , so their grand@@ mom@@ s look like ger@@ tru@@ de stein , their dau@@ gh@@ ters looks like hal@@ le ber@@ ry -- i don &apos;t know how they &apos;ve done that .
people with stro@@ kes and les@@ i@@ ons in the emotion@@ -@@ process@@ ing parts of the brain are not super smart , they &apos;re actually sometimes quite hel@@ pl@@ ess .
but i think this research shows that the british en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , or the scot@@ tish en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , with david hu@@ me , adam smith , actually had a better hand@@ le on who we are -- that reason is often we@@ ak , our sen@@ ti@@ ments are strong , and our sen@@ ti@@ ments are often tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ six percent of college students say they have abo@@ ve-@@ average social skills .
but this is the source of innovation .
thank you .
and i tell you stories from there .
we are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fa@@ thers , un@@ cles , cou@@ s@@ ins , all around us .
she works for a very big company , a work@@ shop in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , making fur@@ ni@@ tures .
it &apos;s very fashi@@ on@@ able to talk about human traff@@ i@@ cking , in this fantastic a-@@ c hall .
i &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more .
just to let you know , i do not have a le@@ xi@@ co@@ graphi@@ cal whi@@ st@@ le .
computers ! what about computers ?
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham bu@@ tt problem .
no . there will still be paper dic@@ tion@@ aries .
you didn &apos;t break it . it &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
if we think of the dic@@ tion@@ ary as being the map of the english language , these bright spo@@ ts are what we know about , and the dark spo@@ ts are where we are in the dark .
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
and we can make the dic@@ tion@@ ary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language .
the date was febru@@ ary 2000 .
we talk about this a lot , and i thought about trying to give an example of this . so , just one example : ma@@ d@@ ame de g@@ au@@ lle , the wife of the french president , was fam@@ ously asked once , &quot; what do you most desire ? &quot;
je@@ ff be@@ z@@ os kin@@ dly re@@ mar@@ ked to me , &quot; chris , ted is a really great conference .
i &apos;m in this for the long run , and i would be great@@ ly hon@@ or@@ ed and excited if you &apos;ll come on this journey with me .
for one thing , gps doesn &apos;t work in@@ do@@ ors , and for another , they don &apos;t make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to rela@@ y their measu@@ re@@ ments back over a network .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it &apos;s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else &apos;s car .
so let me show you how this works .
so something felt very wrong about the world .
we call ourselves por@@ s and ra@@ o , and we live and work in india .
this is a video prototyp@@ e .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
and once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this cre@@ ature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , bes@@ i@@ des jobs , is electricity .
li@@ ke@@ wise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re disco@@ vering that the 80 solar farm sch@@ em@@ es that are going forward want to basically bu@@ ll@@ do@@ ze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
so argu@@ ing against , a man who &apos;s been at the ni@@ tty , gri@@ tty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
and this doesn &apos;t even account for the foot@@ print on the ground .
over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land .
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arc@@ tic to melt and other places to melt more .
solving the world &apos;s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , rene@@ w@@ able energy .
thank you .
so each of you has really just a couple sent@@ ences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless .
we explore for three reasons , the we@@ ak@@ est of which is curi@@ osity .
the shu@@ ttle is co@@ sting a billion dollars a laun@@ ch .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the pri@@ ce-@@ impro@@ vement cur@@ ve that -- we need some break@@ through@@ s in physics along the way , i &apos;ll gr@@ ant you that .
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ce@@ os , c@@ mo@@ s .
when you want the taste that won &apos;t wei@@ gh you down , the only way to go is up .
then , you &apos;ve got to , you know , face potential public ridi@@ cule of -- that &apos;s a crazy idea , it &apos;ll never work .
nature &apos;s main process of creation , mor@@ pho@@ gen@@ es@@ is , is the spli@@ tting of one cell into two cells .
i designed the process that gener@@ ated the form .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the over@@ all form and the microscop@@ ic surface detail .
it took me several months to design the colum@@ n , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calcu@@ late all of the 16 million faces .
there &apos;s that di@@ p there for the 19@@ 18 flu .
you we@@ ed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
it &apos;s called hu@@ t@@ chin@@ son@@ -@@ gil@@ ford pro@@ geria , and it is the most dra@@ matic form of pre@@ ma@@ ture aging .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to gener@@ alize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4@@ ,000 that are waiting for answers .
you probably know , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to some of the science liter@@ ature that you can now take a skin cell and encoura@@ ge it to become a li@@ ver cell or a heart cell or a kid@@ ney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
if you don &apos;t believe me , just ask sam .
and for us young people , they &apos;re looking to become individuals and find their differences am@@ on@@ gst themselves .
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discus@@ sing them .
this institution is govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked and it has been the case for the past three decades .
us@@ eless .
my work is -- it &apos;s a refle@@ ction of myself .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
it became part of me .
and i looked at it bene@@ ath the microscop@@ e . and some of it was flat .
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
can anybody see the bla@@ de on the end of that need@@ le ?
and i looked at it underneath the microscop@@ e .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
i used a microscop@@ ic sh@@ ard of diam@@ ond to actually car@@ ve the actual base .
constru@@ cted each plan@@ k of gold .
and these doctors or these ma@@ sters , these spi@@ ritual ma@@ sters of the su@@ f@@ i tradition , re@@ fer to teach@@ ings and examples of our prop@@ he@@ t that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
all we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ go@@ tis@@ m out of the way .
and these should also be the primary at@@ tribu@@ tes of what it means to be human .
and one day i was explor@@ ing this cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sa@@ c hidden away a few streets away .
the next day i came to see him . i was like , &quot; doctor , that was a really good jo@@ ke . &quot;
in ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as they don &apos;t even ask . &quot;
and je@@ ff came up bes@@ i@@ de me and said , &quot; so , have you ever been co@@ w ti@@ pping ? &quot;
two weeks after my diagno@@ sis , a bi@@ op@@ sy con@@ fir@@ med i had a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch o@@ ste@@ o@@ sar@@ com@@ a in my left fe@@ mu@@ r .
and i hung up the phone , and i put my face in my hands , and i scre@@ am@@ ed this sil@@ ent scre@@ am .
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually conne@@ cting to all these people .
don &apos;t give in to the wall .
and every seven sets of seven years , the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are re@@ united and people surro@@ unded with the ones they love .
so if you go to 2@@ 3@@ and@@ me , or if you go to coun@@ c@@ il@@ o@@ f@@ da@@ d@@ s@@ .com , you can click on a link .
a@@ o : you did teach yourself to play , and as a con@@ sequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
dp : &quot; flight of the bu@@ m@@ ble@@ be@@ e &quot; on that note .
dp : he played &quot; ch@@ op@@ sti@@ cks . &quot; a@@ o : and played &quot; ch@@ op@@ sti@@ cks . &quot;
this is known as the theme building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very mur@@ ky .
does anyone know ? ch@@ i ?
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t cont@@ amin@@ ated , a world that isn &apos;t pollu@@ ted .
and we use gs@@ i -- geographic whatever it is , gs@@ i -- to deter@@ mine the range of the ch@@ im@@ ps .
we now know that at g@@ om@@ be alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanze@@ es use different objects for different pur@@ pos@@ es .
so , the sad thing is that these chimpanze@@ es -- who &apos;ve perhaps taught us , more than any other cre@@ ature , a little hu@@ mili@@ ty -- are in the wild , disappe@@ aring very fast .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanze@@ es or other living creatures , is this sophisti@@ cated spo@@ ken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here .
there &apos;s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , i be@@ g that you pick up that bro@@ ch@@ ure .
we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral hi@@ stories .
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
it &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a proto@@ cell .
it could run a me@@ tab@@ oli@@ s@@ m on it .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to susta@@ in itself .
so since we can make some interesting proto@@ cells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &apos;re very easy to make , and they have interesting life@@ like properties , perhaps these proto@@ cells have something to tell us about the orig@@ in of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily acc@@ essi@@ ble step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .
this is used in re@@ ference to a report in 2007 by the national research coun@@ cil in the united states , wher@@ ein they tried to understand how we can look for life el@@ se@@ where in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ?
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
the cul@@ min@@ ation of this is if you &apos;ve success@@ fully raised your ta@@ d@@ pole , obser@@ ving the behavi@@ oral and develop@@ mental events , you will then go and introdu@@ ce your ta@@ d@@ pole to its nam@@ es@@ a@@ ke and disc@@ uss the evidence that you &apos;ve seen .
there &apos;s an old cell@@ phone in there -- a good use for old cell@@ phones -- which di@@ als the clin@@ ic , we go and pick up the mouse .
what the climate crisis has reve@@ aled to us is a secon@@ dar@@ y , more insi@@ di@@ ous and more per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve crisis , which is the crisis of agen@@ cy , which is what to do .
and then i swa@@ p it out with the students and actually re-@@ rele@@ ase that carbon black .
and an early test which argument e@@ lic@@ ited co@@ oper@@ ative behavior from the people below -- about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us .
in this case , instead of thro@@ wing che@@ wing g@@ um , or dor@@ it@@ os or whatever you have in your po@@ cket at the fish -- there &apos;s a body of water in ic@@ eland that i &apos;ve been dealing with that &apos;s in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution bur@@ den on it is not the ro@@ ad@@ bor@@ ne pollution , it &apos;s actually white bread from people fe@@ eding the fish and the birds .
did you know that today we main@@ tain a global her@@ d of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , da@@ ir@@ y , eg@@ gs and lea@@ ther goods ?
the animal could be a co@@ w , lam@@ b , or even something more ex@@ o@@ tic .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
he didn &apos;t write &quot; little red laptop computer &quot; or &quot; little red di@@ rt de@@ vil . &quot;
and sequ@@ el truly is a real car .
we actually think the future &apos;s going to be event@@ -@@ driven .
and secon@@ dly , it &apos;s a fundamental business pro@@ position .
so my mom said , &quot; you &apos;re going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day . &quot;
he &apos;s like , &quot; no , miss , i &apos;m not going .
anima@@ tion , software , mo@@ vie@@ making software , they have it all .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger -- where i did the second part of secon@@ dar@@ y school .
you must stop . stop .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government .
i put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the new@@ spa@@ pers millions of fish that die in nor@@ way .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same conc@@ ern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transp@@ l@@ ant it here .
i &apos;d go to times square and i &apos;d look at the amazing ladies on the wall , and wonder why nobody is looking at the histor@@ ical fig@@ ures just behind them .
you can see the li@@ spen@@ ard me@@ a@@ do@@ ws dra@@ ining down through here , through what is tri@@ bec@@ a now , and the be@@ ach@@ es that come up from the battery , all the way to 4@@ 2@@ n@@ d st .
we know that there was a len@@ ap@@ e sett@@ le@@ ment down here by the collect pon@@ d .
and rapi@@ dly we started to realize that be@@ a@@ vers can be something that a bo@@ b@@ c@@ at needs .
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe na@@ tive americans were there .
and even though i &apos;ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you appreci@@ ate that man@@ na@@ hat@@ ta was a very special place .
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very pro@@ sper@@ ous , and th@@ us use a lot of stuff .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start fig@@ uring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monit@@ or@@ ing , the amount we &apos;re actually using .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
so one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
so l@@ ul@@ a , he &apos;s full of problems , full of con@@ tradi@@ ctions , but one of the things that he &apos;s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international rela@@ tions that completely shif@@ ts the balance from the standard sort of nor@@ th-@@ south dialo@@ gue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
here &apos;s a design for dist@@ ill@@ ing water using sun@@ light .
you know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
sop@@ a stands for the stop online pi@@ ra@@ cy act .
we do like to consu@@ me , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
they don &apos;t want legal distin@@ ctions between legal and illegal sharing .
it changed my life .
&quot; what are you doing here ?
so the college works following the lifest@@ yle and work@@ style of ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
we are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually ca@@ sting as@@ per@@ sions on the bar@@ e@@ foot architec@@ ts of ti@@ lon@@ ia .
but the people who fabri@@ cated that solar coo@@ ker are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually fabri@@ cate the most sophisti@@ cated solar coo@@ ker .
she has a cab@@ in@@ et , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
men are rest@@ less , men are ambi@@ tious , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely mobile , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
and they haven &apos;t collap@@ sed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
our narra@@ tive here is real f@@ mr@@ i data that &apos;s ma@@ pped visu@@ ally and son@@ ically .
oxygen , hydro@@ gen and zin@@ c have their own sig@@ nature .
and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tri@@ pl@@ ed in mass , going from the one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ quar@@ ter po@@ und brain of our ance@@ st@@ or here , hab@@ ili@@ s , to the almost three-@@ po@@ und me@@ at@@ lo@@ a@@ f that everybody here has between their e@@ ars .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after w@@ inning the lot@@ to , lot@@ tery w@@ inn@@ ers and par@@ ap@@ legi@@ cs are equ@@ ally happy with their lives .
who are these characters who are so dam@@ n happy ?
and then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worl@@ ds -- some of you recognize this young photo of pe@@ te best , who was the original dru@@ mmer for the be@@ at@@ les , until they , you know , sent him out on an er@@ rand and s@@ nu@@ ck away and picked up ring@@ o on a tour .
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are mon@@ et prin@@ ts .
we expla@@ ined we would have number three ma@@ iled to them .
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those deli@@ cious fu@@ tures and find the one that you would most enjoy .
so we gave them c@@ ameras ; they went around cam@@ pus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite profess@@ ors and their dor@@ m room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memor@@ ies of .
they don &apos;t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to swa@@ p has ex@@ pi@@ red , they still don &apos;t like their picture . why ?
thank you .
sometimes they just explo@@ de before your eyes or come down su@@ person@@ ic .
i have a little cu@@ ban mother -- she &apos;s about that big .
&quot; pa@@ p@@ i , help . &quot;
i was born in 19 -- i forget , and i came to this country with them in the after@@ math of the cu@@ ban revolution .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dy@@ ed , you know , that pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar color of blue that mat@@ ches her pol@@ ye@@ ster pants suit , you know , same color as the bu@@ i@@ ck .
she gets into the car -- she &apos;s sitting on two phone books .
it &apos;ll help my brea@@ thing . it &apos;ll do something for my pul@@ se , maybe .
now , you have all been at a m@@ all during the ho@@ li@@ days , yes ?
by now , we have now cra@@ w@@ led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &quot; i knew it , i knew it .
we &apos;ll wait for the slow ones . ok .
&quot; no , my daughter , she &apos;s coming in the bu@@ i@@ ck .
people are watching us all around , &quot; right ?
i almost miss it .
what zi@@ p@@ car does is we park cars throughout den@@ se urban areas for members to reser@@ ve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car .
it requi@@ red that it was completely tri@@ vi@@ al : that it takes 30 seconds to reser@@ ve a car , go get it , drive it .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &apos;s will@@ ing@@ ness to reduce their driving behavior .
these are also called mes@@ h networks .
these are the next two lines in the movie .
and this open-@@ source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly .
2006 was a great year .
and as these dark clou@@ ds were cir@@ cl@@ ing me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
i &apos;d love to just talk about each one brie@@ fly .
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hit@@ ting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
so those are the three a &apos;s .
he &apos;s like , &quot; do you know where mor@@ oc@@ co even is ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the sad part .
tour@@ ist : i think that people are very fru@@ strated that they &apos;re not able to get closer to see what &apos;s going on .
and i thought it was ast@@ on@@ ishing to spe@@ cu@@ late , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wo@@ und .
d@@ r : it was not an inclu@@ sive group .
so dealing with it is just an immedi@@ ate master plan .
sort of like the spin@@ al ta@@ p scene where you get the tiny little st@@ one@@ hen@@ ge , i guess ?
it &apos;s all incredibly hum@@ ble material .
and i truly believe until the issue of memor@@ ial is sor@@ ted out , that it &apos;s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion .
those kinds of forms ?
so you can get kind of a feel for this .
but how about the kid on the left , or the ath@@ le@@ te that leaves the field of play ?
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with .
how old it is ?
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offen@@ sive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to do@@ od@@ le offi@@ cially means to da@@ w@@ d@@ le , to di@@ l@@ ly d@@ ally , to mon@@ key around , to make meaning@@ less mar@@ ks , to do something of little value , sub@@ stance or im@@ port , and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing .
we think do@@ od@@ ling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a pre@@ emp@@ tive measure to stop you from losing focus .
in 200@@ 2 , a group of treatment activi@@ sts met to disc@@ uss the early development of the airplane .
treatment programs became possible , fund@@ ing became available , and the number of people on anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs started to increase very rapi@@ dly .
so sur@@ ely if a patent pool could be establi@@ shed to ra@@ mp up the production of military air@@ planes , we should be able to do something similar to t@@ ack@@ le the hiv / aids epidemic .
the rule is about a 10@@ -@@ year del@@ ay for a new product to go to market in developing countries , if at all .
what about ath@@ ens ? medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t percei@@ ve comfort .
instead of blo@@ wing a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e of chil@@ led air through the sta@@ dium , we can use radi@@ ant cool@@ ing technologies , like a floor he@@ ating system where water pi@@ pes are em@@ bed@@ ded in the floor .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different cli@@ matic par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable out@@ door conditions , to change our ther@@ mal perception that we feel comfortable in an out@@ door environment , and we can do that with the best passi@@ ve design , but also using the energy source of the site in q@@ at@@ ar which is the sun .
the main thing is a fi@@ x-@@ it@@ -@@ lo@@ cally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &apos;t have to go through a huge bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic system to get it fix@@ ed .
they are basically refer@@ ral services , essentially .
so we are right now doing some syste@@ matic field tests to basically as@@ certain whether something like this actually makes sense to the as@@ ha wor@@ ker .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pa@@ irs of people connected to each other .
and , most importantly , what causes the clu@@ sters ?
and we thought this was a very interesting com@@ ment on america , and a kind of self-@@ ser@@ ving , &quot; not my responsibility &quot; kind of phenomenon .
i mean , there would be an advantage to experi@@ en@@ cing our emotions inside , you know , an@@ ger or happiness .
so to inv@@ o@@ ke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabri@@ c of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to you and you to her , on out end@@ less@@ ly into the distance -- this fabri@@ c is actually like an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned american qu@@ il@@ t , and it has pat@@ ches on it : happy and un@@ happy pat@@ ches .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are ar@@ ran@@ ged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphi@@ te , which is soft and dark .
you read about it in your new@@ spa@@ pers .
the c@@ d@@ c recently condu@@ cted a survey where they asked respon@@ dents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psych@@ ological dist@@ ress in the previous week .
in our study , they are more positive , but they &apos;re also more likely than yo@@ unger people to experience mix@@ ed emotions -- sa@@ dness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that te@@ ar in the eye when you &apos;re s@@ mil@@ ing at a friend .
we go on blind dat@@ es .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super@@ -@@ human strength and abilities .
we got ma@@ d@@ d ch@@ add , li@@ l &apos; c , kid david and j smo@@ oth .
the l@@ x@@ d electri@@ fy the ted@@ 2010 stage with an emerging global stre@@ et@@ -@@ dance culture , re@@ v@@ ved up by the internet . in a pre@@ view of j@@ on ch@@ u &apos;s up@@ coming web series , this ast@@ on@@ ishing trou@@ pe show off their super@@ power@@ s .
according to the treat@@ y , those lands are a so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n nation .
we had plans .
on dec@@ ember 2@@ 9@@ th , u.s. tro@@ ops surro@@ unded a si@@ ou@@ x en@@ cam@@ pment at wo@@ unded k@@ nee cre@@ ek and mas@@ sac@@ red ch@@ ie@@ f big foot and 300 pris@@ on@@ ers of war , using a new rapi@@ d-@@ fire wea@@ pon that fi@@ red explo@@ ding sh@@ ells called a hot@@ ch@@ k@@ is@@ s gun .
2010 : statistics about na@@ tive population today , more than a century after the mas@@ sac@@ re at wo@@ unded k@@ nee , reve@@ al the leg@@ acy of col@@ oni@@ zation , forced migra@@ tion and treat@@ y viol@@ ations .
those events led to a domin@@ o effect that has yet to end .
so , that &apos;s really the goal of my talk , is to a , communicate that moment to you and b , have you leave this s@@ ession a little du@@ mber than when you enter@@ ed .
many of these dea@@ ths were completely pre@@ vent@@ able , and this what i want to think of as the dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem .
inter@@ cro@@ pping . inter@@ cro@@ pping really incre@@ ases income .
so , here are these women . they &apos;ve seen their parents have strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they &apos;ve strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they &apos;ve seen lots of dea@@ ths . how do they answer this question ?
so , somebody out there says , &quot; five . &quot;
almost out of kinder@@ garten .
they are saying , &quot; this is 35 miles per gall@@ on . i &apos;m going to do the environ@@ ment@@ ally right thing , i &apos;m going to buy the pri@@ us , 50 miles per gall@@ on . &quot;
now , this is an example of that battle , and makes us realize inten@@ tions don &apos;t always trans@@ late into action , and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that . ok ?
this isn &apos;t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
the care@@ ful testing , re@@ testing , design , are going to open up vi@@ st@@ as of understanding , comple@@ xi@@ ties , difficult things .
ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur w@@ inner sen@@ d@@ hi@@ l mul@@ la@@ in@@ a@@ than uses the l@@ ens of behavi@@ oral economics to study a tri@@ cky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &apos;t . we know how to reduce child dea@@ ths due to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , how to prevent diab@@ et@@ es@@ -@@ related blin@@ dness and how to imple@@ ment sol@@ ar-@@ cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . why ?
right , the current wants to run through the pla@@ y-@@ d@@ ough , not through that led .
so i would encoura@@ ge you all to gra@@ b some pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , gra@@ b some s@@ alt , gra@@ b some sugar and start playing .
and a friend of mine in au@@ stri@@ a felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest cas@@ in@@ o ow@@ ner in lin@@ z into le@@ tting us wra@@ p his building .
but i will demon@@ strate different ways to get rid of diffic@@ ul@@ ties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quick@@ er than ar@@ th@@ ur did . so , first , we viol@@ ate the common sense , the lo@@ gic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees -- all of you . not you .
now , i need an assi@@ stant .
that &apos;s a challenge . i like this .
so here i have , actually -- i know exactly where the cards are .
and if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have -- that &apos;s the pas@@ s@@ word to the co@@ s@@ mic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
and then , i will demon@@ strate a thing from russi@@ an satelli@@ te , ste@@ alen -- stol@@ en , probably cop@@ i@@ ed from america but we will see .
when i li@@ ft the hea@@ p , i pe@@ ek .
we do it again .
this is a kind of op@@ tical deal , right ?
now -- -- one guy laugh@@ ed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
king of spa@@ des .
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good .
right ? good .
two -- and it was two of spa@@ des , right ?
yes ? zo@@ e : yeah .
king of diam@@ on@@ ds . l@@ g : ah !
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , enga@@ ged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit pu@@ ber@@ ty , or whatever it is .
and your children are playing instru@@ ments .
the ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f people , they &apos;re no longer here .
now , it goes down to a. now to g@@ . and then to f .
and then finally ...
finally , i said , &quot; why am i cla@@ pping ? &quot;
he depen@@ ds , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
some of you might have seen this before .
it &apos;s a nice motiv@@ ator .
so gl@@ u@@ ck@@ s@@ berg did another experiment similar to this where he pres@@ ented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . okay ?
the rules are my@@ sti@@ fying .
what happens ?
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
it &apos;s pretty . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge tra@@ de@@ mark viol@@ ation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .
do it for fun . no one gets paid a cent , or a eur@@ o or a y@@ en .
so , it can balance on a point .
so here is the earth . it &apos;s a little less than a milli@@ meter that was turned of soli@@ d bron@@ ze .
this is another species of work that i do .
and the idea that you could see things inside of a cr@@ y@@ st@@ al ball and predict the future -- or a television set , where it &apos;s sort of like a magic box where anything can appear .
it &apos;s completely sil@@ ent and non@@ pollu@@ ting .
the real social innovation i want to talk about invol@@ ves char@@ ity .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
char@@ it@@ able giving has rema@@ ined stuck , in the u.s. , at two percent of g@@ dp ever since we started meas@@ uring it in the 197@@ 0s .
well , like most fan@@ a@@ tical do@@ g@@ ma in america , these ideas come from old pu@@ ri@@ tan belie@@ fs .
within nine years , we had multi@@ pli@@ ed that 1,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 times into 10@@ 8 million dollars after all expen@@ ses for aids services .
but if we could move char@@ it@@ able giving from two percent of g@@ dp up just one step to three percent of g@@ dp , by invest@@ ing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contribu@@ tions , and if that money could go dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately to health and human services ch@@ ari@@ ties , because those were the ones we encoura@@ ged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tri@@ pl@@ ing of contribu@@ tions to that sector .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
you know , audi@@ ences like you , yeah , make the event .
can we have a little demon@@ stration ? would you be my orche@@ str@@ a for a second ?
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... &quot;
and then like kar@@ a@@ j@@ an . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ?
meaning that you know you have no auth@@ ority to change anything .
this is very exciting for those players .
rather enjo@@ ying what the sol@@ o@@ ist is doing .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustain@@ ability means basically looking at the glob@@ alized economic growth model , and moder@@ ating what comes in at one end , and moder@@ ating the out@@ puts at the other end .
but are we to assu@@ me that the same brilli@@ ance and creativity and adap@@ t@@ ability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow myster@@ i@@ ously going to ev@@ apo@@ rate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually fe@@ asi@@ ble .
it lear@@ ns very much from its mistakes .
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ir@@ eland , where i was teaching , and has since spread .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has vir@@ ally swe@@ pt around the world .
well , this is about state bud@@ gets .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more re@@ venue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get conf@@ used and think , well maybe you think that &apos;s okay .
so what do we need to do ?
it allows us to do the art , the biot@@ echn@@ ology , the software and all those magic things .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to sho@@ ot for the impossible before taking the mc@@ at and appl@@ ying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gu@@ p@@ ta .
ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pur@@ sue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
these people i still do hang out with .
all right , next .
don &apos;t they just pop into your head ?
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment .
had he shown his father , &quot; my boy has finally lost it , &quot; he would &apos;ve thought .
the french writer mich@@ el tour@@ ni@@ er has a famous saying .
and i expla@@ ined , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a cro@@ w is per@@ ching on a bran@@ ch . &quot;
yes , it means i didn &apos;t have to draw g@@ ye@@ on@@ g@@ ho@@ er@@ u .
we become dic@@ tat@@ ors with a remote and start to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the people on tv .
i walk around and encoura@@ ge them , &quot; come on , come on ! &quot; they have to write like crazy for an hour or two .
art is the ulti@@ mate goal .
only those three words and she left the air@@ port . that &apos;s it .
british physi@@ c@@ ist john ty@@ n@@ d@@ all , in the 18@@ 50 &apos;s , made laboratory measu@@ re@@ ments of the in@@ fr@@ ared radiation , which is heat .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission stat@@ ement , &quot; to understand and protect the home planet , &quot; to justi@@ fy my talks .
climate change den@@ i@@ ers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
me@@ than@@ e is also beginning to es@@ cape from the per@@ ma@@ fro@@ st .
it would be im@@ moral to leave these young people with a climate system spir@@ aling out of control .
the science is clear .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is y@@ ak@@ im@@ a can@@ u@@ tt .
we can do bigger car stun@@ ts than ever before now .
i sort of forget how bizar@@ re some of those conver@@ sa@@ tions are .
two st@@ unt guys doing what i consider to be a rather ben@@ ig@@ n st@@ unt .
it &apos;s that shape because the heli@@ um has to exp@@ and .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right ballo@@ on team to build the ballo@@ on that would do this job .
i cont@@ ac@@ ted a company in the states who make su@@ its for nasa .
this is a very ligh@@ t@@ weight suit . it wei@@ gh@@ s about 15 pounds .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
in fact , we moved from strat@@ ford to los angeles .
why not ? i think this is rather important .
so the hier@@ arch@@ y is ro@@ ot@@ ed on two ideas .
in fact , creativity -- which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different discipl@@ in@@ ary ways of seeing things .
i said , &quot; what happened ? &quot;
now is the time for us to lau@@ gh at ourselves , before others can lau@@ gh with us .
so i re@@ treated back to my ca@@ ve and continu@@ ed to support and produce com@@ e@@ dy and let my friends use my cou@@ ch as a regi@@ onal oper@@ ations hu@@ b .
so everywhere we went , we audi@@ tioned ama@@ te@@ urs .
one : is the middle east being shown in a current time and cor@@ rect context ?
early dete@@ ction , early interven@@ tion , that &apos;s the story for these success@@ es .
fif@@ ty percent will have on@@ set by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hyper@@ ten@@ sion -- most of the major ill@@ n@@ esses that we think about as being sources of mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these dis@@ orders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there &apos;s a lot of vari@@ ation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predic@@ table patterns , and those patterns are risk fac@@ tors for developing one of these dis@@ orders .
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go .
how many children will you get ?
but how wrong it is .
it &apos;s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give th@@ um@@ b@@ prin@@ ts in the atten@@ dance regi@@ ster .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different min@@ d@@ set , a totally different society .
is it the ex@@ pos@@ ure ? we have profess@@ ors from mit , ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific for@@ mul@@ as , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
when i started par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma i began with a great deal of ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce of trans@@ forming the world .
now that sounds like an incredibly stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward question to answer , and that &apos;s what howard thought . because pe@@ p@@ s@@ i told him , &quot; look , we &apos;re working with a band between eight and 12 percent .
you should be looking for the perfect pe@@ p@@ sis . &quot;
every conc@@ ei@@ vable way you can v@@ ary sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce , he vari@@ ed sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce .
what howard did is he fundament@@ ally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy .
much more vol@@ a@@ ti@@ le brown mu@@ star@@ d se@@ ed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more de@@ lic@@ ate aro@@ ma@@ tics . and what do they do ?
and she ser@@ ves it that way time and time again , and if you quar@@ re@@ l with her , she will say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a bre@@ w -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average sc@@ ore in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
we have pre-@@ can@@ cer@@ ous les@@ i@@ ons , which often don &apos;t turn into cancer .
if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
so , dad gradu@@ ated harvard in 194@@ 6 , married my mom , and bought a house in le@@ x@@ ing@@ ton , mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts , where the first sh@@ ots were fi@@ red against the british in 17@@ 75 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until con@@ cor@@ d .
and , yeah , we can look back in retro@@ spe@@ ct and say , yeah , ha@@ -@@ ha , you know -- it &apos;s all micro@@ film . but that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
and if you go on the diag@@ onal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
so i wrote a book about this in &apos; 9@@ 3 , but as i was fin@@ ishing the book , i had to do a little bit of typ@@ es@@ et@@ ting , and i was ti@@ red of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
we could do cir@@ cular narra@@ tives that were literally cir@@ cular .
why is this important ?
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed that ex@@ act diffic@@ ul@@ ty on a daily basis , i had never seen the in@@ her@@ ent challenge of communication in so cr@@ y@@ st@@ all@@ ine a light .
and the key detail of this is that fe@@ y &apos;s scri@@ p@@ ts weren &apos;t written by her and they weren &apos;t written by the s@@ n@@ l wri@@ ters .
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the vi@@ ral appe@@ al of a great jo@@ ke with a powerful pun@@ ch@@ line that &apos;s cra@@ f@@ ted from hon@@ est@@ y and integri@@ ty , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
that is a lot of pun@@ ch for 14 words .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
it reach@@ es up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , pri@@ mar@@ ily .
they school as ad@@ oles@@ cents , and become be@@ he@@ mot@@ h lon@@ ers as adults .
so the great thing about the mol@@ a is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that &apos;s stre@@ aming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- you can see they stri@@ ke this funny little position that says , &quot; i &apos;m not thre@@ at@@ ening , but i need a mas@@ sage . &quot;
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not sl@@ ac@@ ker , la@@ zy fish .
it was a 200@@ -@@ foot diam@@ e@@ ter ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic sphere to be sus@@ pen@@ ded over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electr@@ onic control , and this is also with only four le@@ ds .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
he realized at once what had happened .
so , have we all become one-@@ e@@ yed -- two-@@ e@@ yed instead of one-@@ e@@ yed -- mon@@ keys ?
and then ab@@ original women in africa would come and say , &quot; this is it ! &quot;
i have a solution that requires nei@@ ther machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
your parents were pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful people .
hell@@ o governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can &apos;t even afford to give them food .
her father the king said , &quot; don &apos;t whi@@ st@@ le . &quot;
&quot; u@@ h-@@ hu@@ h ... &quot; she said .
and lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
von ne@@ um@@ ann , and a logi@@ cian , and a mathemati@@ cian from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
so , there &apos;s 40 of these tu@@ bes , like a v-@@ 40 engine running the memory .
&quot; mani@@ a@@ c re@@ ga@@ ined its memory , when the power went off . &quot; &quot; machine or human ? &quot;
this now is the third different out@@ put .
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
and it was his universe on pun@@ ch cards .
and that &apos;s the end .
look at hom@@ i@@ cide at the bottom , for god &apos;s sa@@ ke .
i went to west virg@@ ini@@ a , the most un@@ healthy state in america .
you see , the thing is o@@ bes@@ ity and di@@ et@@ -@@ related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , si@@ sters .
now it &apos;s lar@@ gely process@@ ed and full of all sorts of addi@@ tives , extra ingre@@ di@@ ents , and you know the rest of the story .
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a speci@@ alist in .
they have sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s in the classroom , but kni@@ ves and for@@ ks ? no .
i want to talk about something so basic as milk .
this , all this bad news , is pre@@ vent@@ able .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
hun@@ t@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s kitchen . hun@@ t@@ ing@@ ton , where i made this program , you know , we &apos;ve got this pri@@ me@@ -@@ time program that hopefully will inspi@@ re people to really get on this change .
dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic , so i &apos;m a bit slow .
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they &apos;ve been ha@@ cked , and those that don &apos;t .
they &apos;re completely anony@@ mous , as it were .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they &apos;re a crimin@@ al ?
now he developed his social and moral comp@@ ass on the black sea port during the 199@@ 0s .
and this man with a planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ si@@ zed brain is now ser@@ ving a 13@@ -@@ year sentence in california .
thank you very much for listening .
public health is another reason to consider retro@@ fit@@ ting .
and the market research , consumer research , asking the bo@@ om@@ ers and gen y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we &apos;re already seeing it -- for more urban lifest@@ y@@ les within sub@@ ur@@ bia .
it &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the stri@@ p across the street .
this one is one of my favor@@ ites , bel@@ ma@@ r .
you want to also try to get more syste@@ mic transformation .
the first is to plan retro@@ fit@@ ting much more syste@@ mi@@ cally at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan scale .
but we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
so i decided to talk to women about their vag@@ in@@ as .
and she said things that really sho@@ cked me about her vagina -- that it was d@@ rie@@ d-@@ up and finished and dead -- and i was kind of sho@@ cked .
and so in 199@@ 7 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s get women together .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
she went to ju@@ are@@ z to take care of an a@@ il@@ ing a@@ unt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happening to the mur@@ dered and disappe@@ ared women of ju@@ are@@ z .
but , being a vagina war@@ ri@@ or , she kept going , and she kept commit@@ ting her@@ self to trans@@ forming consciousness .
well , it seems to me that this h@@ ung@@ arian pres@@ ence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to an ad@@ mi@@ ration for people with a complex moral awareness , with a her@@ it@@ age of gu@@ il@@ t and de@@ fe@@ at mat@@ ched by de@@ fi@@ ance and bra@@ va@@ do .
and then one day , it happened : he and his family were ar@@ re@@ sted and they were taken to a death house on the dan@@ u@@ be .
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler hi@@ red 16 men : eight white , eight black .
and into the slow , second movement , mar@@ ked &quot; ada@@ gi@@ o religi@@ o@@ so , &quot; he in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated the sounds of bir@@ d@@ song that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring ; he was imag@@ ining a future for her in which he would play no part .
and it was only at that moment , as we were sitting down to dinner , that i recogni@@ zed the enor@@ m@@ ity of the risk i had created , because to bring these two ti@@ t@@ ans , these two ma@@ sters of the universe together -- it was like intro@@ duc@@ ing mo@@ thr@@ a to go@@ d@@ z@@ ill@@ a over the sky@@ line of to@@ k@@ yo .
and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bac@@ chan@@ al by ti@@ ti@@ an . &quot;
and in about 199@@ 7 , the th@@ en-@@ director phili@@ ppe de mon@@ te@@ b@@ ell@@ o gave me the go@@ -@@ ahead to organi@@ ze an exhi@@ bi@@ tion for 200@@ 2 . we normally have these very long le@@ ad@@ -@@ in times .
and in this extraordinary setting , the co@@ st@@ um@@ es were like ac@@ tors and ac@@ tr@@ esses , or living sculp@@ tures .
i &apos;m working to try and break down that sense of that eli@@ tis@@ m .
but we take the sever@@ e ones , and we res@@ che@@ du@@ le the other ones the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russi@@ a , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; so@@ vi@@ et union .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
i &apos;m going to take you on a 16@@ -@@ minute trip on 7@@ 2 percent of the planet , so bu@@ ck@@ le up .
you know , we &apos;re going to do this , we &apos;re going to take it away from something else .
and like a living organis@@ m , you te@@ ar it open , it ble@@ e@@ ds its mol@@ ten blood , ris@@ es up to he@@ al that wo@@ und from the as@@ th@@ en@@ o@@ sphere , har@@ dens , forms new tissue and moves lat@@ er@@ ally .
so , we came up with multiple hypo@@ thes@@ es : there &apos;s little green people down there taking it ; there &apos;s all sorts of things going on .
we st@@ um@@ bled on it , looking for some missing heat .
near that was me@@ than@@ e . i &apos;ve never seen vol@@ can@@ o@@ es of me@@ than@@ e .
fortunately , we &apos;ve been able to convince con@@ gress .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s suddenly possible .
since we opened the website in febru@@ ary , we now have 6@@ 4@@ 0,000 students from 19@@ 0 countries .
other students might be interested in a particular en@@ rich@@ ment top@@ ic that they want to pur@@ sue individu@@ ally .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathematical expres@@ sions as well as mathematical der@@ i@@ va@@ tions .
which is not a level of service i have ever off@@ ered to my stanford students .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in a one-@@ on-@@ one instru@@ ction using a tu@@ tor .
you can see , for example , that the achie@@ vement sc@@ ore almost dou@@ bles in this particular experiment .
k@@ ak@@ i king : playing &quot; p@@ ink noise &quot; on gu@@ it@@ ar
&quot; learn the l@@ ingu@@ a fran@@ ca . &quot;
e@@ mi@@ ly le@@ v@@ ine : richard . what did i say ?
i don &apos;t know if you know this but -- maybe it &apos;s different now , or maybe you were making a stat@@ ement -- but in many hospital nur@@ series across the country , until very recently anyway , according to a book by j@@ essi@@ ca ben@@ jam@@ in , the sig@@ ns over the little boys cri@@ bs read , &quot; i &apos;m a boy , &quot; and the sig@@ ns over the little girls cri@@ bs read , &quot; it &apos;s a girl . &quot; yeah .
so this whole subje@@ c@@ t-@@ object thing has relev@@ ance to humor in this way .
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analy@@ ze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &quot; tri@@ ck@@ ster makes this world , &quot; by le@@ wi@@ s hy@@ de .
if they had had an olymp@@ ics in mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , my grandmother would have lost on purpose .
this is what i tend to see almost more than con@@ tradi@@ ctions .
and the mother is el@@ der@@ ly .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &apos;ll be on the wa@@ vel@@ ength of your audience .
there are really serious cal@@ am@@ i@@ ties star@@ ing us in the eye that we &apos;re in the same kind of den@@ ial about that we were about terror@@ ism , and what could &apos;ve happened on september 11 .
199@@ 5 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 -- we &apos;re finding about two or three a month .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a scre@@ ed .
number seven : partic@@ le acceler@@ ator mis@@ ha@@ p .
now , cor@@ n origin@@ ated , we think , in mexico .
we need to learn how to re@@ pair and re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the earth &apos;s o@@ zone layer .
we &apos;ve all learned what -- the kind of pan@@ ic that can occu@@ r when an old disease re@@ ars its head , like anth@@ ra@@ x .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spu@@ n out of orbit .
of more conc@@ ern , i think , is the astero@@ ids that exist between mars and ju@@ pit@@ er .
when the mission was over , they actually land@@ ed on the thing .
bas@@ h@@ o was a brilliant man .
and these two war against one another almost continu@@ ously .
all right , let &apos;s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
mod@@ el@@ ing : on the right hand side , there &apos;s a very complex compu@@ ta@@ tional model .
we are already l@@ ac@@ ed up as if we &apos;re in a fi@@ ber op@@ tic cor@@ set , if you like .
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
we pu@@ mp the flu@@ id through one of these systems , and we press the butt@@ on , and it &apos;s analy@@ zed for the genom@@ ic character .
so we can bring an entirely new tele@@ pres@@ ence to the world , throughout the ocean .
and i think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occu@@ p@@ y .
it &apos;s like the old las v@@ eg@@ as used to be .
our whole practice depen@@ ds on computing .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to gra@@ pp@@ le with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expec@@ tations and to create a cri@@ ti@@ que .
so again , the un@@ expected which is also the ra@@ w .
and it &apos;s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mu@@ te .
it &apos;s about creating with mini@@ mal means something which can not be repe@@ ated , cannot be simul@@ ated in any other sphere .
com@@ promise , if it &apos;s arti@@ stic , if it is able to cop@@ e with its strategi@@ es -- and there is my first sk@@ et@@ ch and the last ren@@ der@@ ing -- it &apos;s not that far away .
that sort of over@@ all sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concern@@ s .
br@@ un@@ o bow@@ den , who &apos;s here , did that , broke the world recor@@ d.@@ em : con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
by the end of this year , you &apos;ll be able to drive from l@@ .@@ a. to new york just using the super@@ char@@ ger network , which char@@ ges at five times the rate of anything else .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re kind of building a new type of distribu@@ ted u@@ tili@@ ty .
would humanity become a spac@@ e-@@ far@@ ing civilization ?
it &apos;s much like on a je@@ t .
these projects are so -- pa@@ yp@@ al , solar@@ city , tes@@ la , spac@@ e@@ x , they &apos;re so spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ arly different , they &apos;re such ambi@@ tious projects at scale .
el@@ on mus@@ k , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
i grew up her@@ ding , looking after our li@@ ve@@ stock -- go@@ ats , she@@ ep and c@@ attle .
because it was war@@ time , the british .@@ 3@@ 0@@ 3 ri@@ f@@ le was just all over the whole country .
and th@@ us , as people started feeling ow@@ ner@@ ship over wild@@ life , wild@@ life numbers started coming back , and that &apos;s actually becoming a foundation for conser@@ vation in nam@@ i@@ bia .
the other part@@ ners that we have got is business communities .
in 2008 , conser@@ van@@ cy gener@@ ated 5@@ .@@ 7 million dollars .
it allows for us to celebra@@ te the se@@ af@@ o@@ od that we &apos;re also so fortun@@ ate to eat .
well , how many bot@@ tles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
they got more cal@@ ories over the course of a diver@@ si@@ fied me@@ al .
i remember well the me@@ als of my childhood .
thank you .
and the great ir@@ ony and trage@@ dy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still argu@@ ing about that .
simil@@ arly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanis@@ ms like ted , and like our relationship with the obama white house , with the sen@@ ate , with john ker@@ ry , to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .
you see the gl@@ aci@@ er flo@@ wing in from the right , dro@@ pping off into the sea , camera sho@@ ot@@ ing every hour .
finally cat@@ ches up to itself , it advan@@ ces .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thi@@ ck , just a gigan@@ tic dom@@ e that comes in from the coast and ris@@ es in the middle .
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet .
the more poli@@ te ones said , &quot; well , you know , indi@@ ans make good software progra@@ mm@@ ers and accoun@@ tan@@ ts , but they can &apos;t do the creative stuff . &quot;
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , a@@ stra@@ zen@@ ec@@ a , general electric , phili@@ ps , have already ans@@ wer@@ ed in the aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive the question that from their bang@@ al@@ ore and hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad r &amp; amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world .
it &apos;s not a new product or a new process but a new way to organi@@ ze work , and the most significant management innovation to come out of india , invented by the indian off@@ shor@@ ing industry is what we call the global deli@@ very model .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reve@@ al this data anymore , so i had to make some esti@@ mates based on various sources .
for a time that i find to be the most plac@@ id and un@@ event@@ ful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
100 years to the day after the death of al@@ fre@@ d no@@ bel himself .
and then -- three par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s later we get this little beauty : &quot; we went back to bla@@ ir house to look at the speech for the last time .
let me first address a few popular mis@@ concep@@ tions .
and when that cell@@ ular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly char@@ ged proteins and al@@ ig@@ ns them .
the expected five year survival is less than five percent .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a ven@@ ge@@ ance .
i am the happ@@ i@@ est , the happ@@ i@@ est person in the world .
and i fir@@ m@@ ly believe that in the next 10 years tumor tre@@ ating fields will be a wea@@ pon available to doctors and patients for all of these mo@@ st-@@ diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ treat soli@@ d tumor@@ s .
and you can notice they have created a kind of fal@@ se cat@@ ch@@ ment .
the age is 400 years .
we had ful@@ l-@@ page adverti@@ se@@ ments , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this can@@ al came .
and it &apos;s a kind of water body for all seas@@ ons .
and they have du@@ b@@ bed this water as the third one called &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
three sides , such steps , on the fourth side there is a four@@ -@@ story building where you can organi@@ ze such ted con@@ fer@@ ences any@@ time .
these arti@@ facts and designs are in@@ spir@@ ing .
it doesn &apos;t matter if this is the jun@@ gles of sing@@ apo@@ re or the tun@@ dr@@ a of northern fin@@ land .
and they &apos;re invest@@ ing in tele@@ com@@ s , sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ alls .
south africa is playing a role .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
and then something happened in 19@@ 80 .
invest .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this lo@@ gic -- that we should be dro@@ pping ipo@@ ds not bom@@ bs -- i mean , it would make a fascinating ti@@ tle for thomas frie@@ d@@ man &apos;s new book .
instead of trying to pur@@ ge these comm@@ ents , they instead went and reach@@ ed out to the blog@@ gers .
right ? so they can go online and contribu@@ te ideas on what that region would look like by the year 20@@ 20 .
so what should we do about it ?
explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
no , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &quot; it would destro@@ y me . &quot;
they called me anth@@ ony growing up as a kid .
we had a whole choice of in@@ appropriate names for her .
the world i en@@ vision for her -- how do i want men to be acting and be@@ having ?
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard acade@@ mic , jo@@ se@@ ph n@@ ye , a friend of mine .
but sometimes it just sat there .
farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of back@@ breaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they &apos;d harv@@ est@@ ed could be sold , what price they &apos;d fe@@ tch .
they had to sus@@ p@@ end fun@@ ctions at 8 : 30 .
and to this day rema@@ ins the only je@@ wish di@@ as@@ por@@ a in the history of the je@@ wish people , which has never en@@ counter@@ ed a single inci@@ dent of anti-@@ se@@ mi@@ tis@@ m .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever@@ -@@ ever@@ -@@ land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but susta@@ ined , above all , by pl@@ ur@@ alist democracy .
tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a is an infe@@ ction of the eye due to di@@ rt can leave you perman@@ ently blind .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young minds in the world .
so probably it doesn &apos;t matter 50 years from now -- stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us and stuff like that will be ra@@ mp@@ ant -- because we won &apos;t be here . but if we are -- we &apos;re going to need something to do with the bacteria .
mission ac@@ compli@@ shed !
there &apos;s nothing in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally swe@@ et about hon@@ ey .
it &apos;s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , mess@@ y di@@ a@@ pers .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighb@@ or , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
thank you . all right .
so we have the finger bla@@ sters . other people have dinosaurs , you know .
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve all seen it , haven &apos;t we ?
great . cool . so i was really interested in quanti@@ ty .
so it was a pretty successful ev@@ ening .
construction play -- it &apos;s play@@ ful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
and of course , by the time you get to the average work@@ place , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post-@@ it notes . it &apos;s pretty bar@@ ren .
we &apos;ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work .
in short , we ad@@ mi@@ re their will@@ ing@@ ness to play .
perhaps in conver@@ gent mode we need to be more serious .
reach@@ ing success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
to be more accu@@ rate , i wanted to be a pop star .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
this is cher@@ y@@ l ang from sing@@ apo@@ re .
and i had the same reaction you did .
&quot; my sister and i used to sing in cho@@ irs together constantly .
you can imagine , with 2,000 syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zed youtube videos , the ren@@ der time is just at@@ ro@@ cious .
this here is nis@@ san &apos;s my@@ lea@@ f , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compe@@ te for who dri@@ ves around the most fuel effici@@ ently .
they want us to fit in even better .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard bu@@ chan@@ an ni@@ c@@ ely put in a recent es@@ say where he said , &quot; products are vi@@ vid argu@@ ments about how we should live our lives . &quot;
workers are treated as well or as b@@ ad@@ ly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &quot;
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14@@ th-@@ century classroom .
and i like that kind of response .
so what have we learned ?
so , a quick stri@@ ke like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ mp -- the same species -- recor@@ ded at 1,000 fra@@ mes a second , played back at 15 fra@@ mes per second .
i hope there aren &apos;t any sna@@ il rights activi@@ sts around here .
it just looks like a sa@@ dd@@ le you &apos;d put on a horse .
in biological systems it &apos;s important not to have a whole lot of extra material requi@@ re@@ ments for building it .
the first peak , obviously , is the lim@@ b hit@@ ting the load cell .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stor@@ ed with that speci@@ alized spring , but the extre@@ mes of the flu@@ id dynam@@ ics . and they might actually be making use of flu@@ id dynam@@ ics as a second force for breaking the sna@@ il .
biolog@@ ist sh@@ ei@@ la pat@@ ek talks about her work meas@@ uring the fe@@ eding stri@@ ke of the man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ mp , one of the fa@@ st@@ est mov@@ ements in the animal world , using video c@@ ameras recor@@ ding at 20@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second .
it turns out that something more than 9@@ 4 percent of life on earth is a@@ qua@@ tic .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
i put rever@@ se thr@@ ust and i try and pull g@@ ently down .
i come back up , not for air .
so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it .
there are problems of se@@ wa@@ ge over@@ flow and cont@@ am@@ ination , but i would also argue that almost every city has this ex@@ act condition , and it &apos;s a condition that we &apos;re all facing .
what is fu@@ zz@@ y rop@@ e , you ask ?
and the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
we had to get rid of the smell .
and eventually s@@ now made a map of the out@@ break .
so that in one generation , we &apos;re going to hal@@ ve our cultural diversity .
so , two months later , i went into ti@@ bet , and i started intervie@@ wing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
this is another leader of his people .
so it was a great experience for him . he sta@@ yed up all night with them , dru@@ mming and dan@@ cing .
and just this last year we &apos;ve taken a group of teen@@ a@@ gers in , and this has worked the best .
and so , i have my first slide to talk about the da@@ w@@ ning of the universe and what i call the co@@ s@@ mic scene investi@@ gation , that is , looking at the reli@@ cs of creation and in@@ fer@@ ring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
and then i &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated .
and then there &apos;s a part of the universe we can &apos;t see because it &apos;s so den@@ se and so hot , light can &apos;t es@@ cape .
they go out and point a telescop@@ e at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , esti@@ mate how far away they are , and p@@ lot them up .
and so now we &apos;re in for some serious play .
so we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in .
so the question is , how hard would it be to assem@@ ble this , right ?
that pul@@ ls in more material and pul@@ ls in more material .
at serious play 2008 , astro@@ physi@@ c@@ ist george smo@@ ot shows stun@@ ning new images from deep@@ -@@ space sur@@ ve@@ ys , and pro@@ ds us to pon@@ der how the co@@ smo@@ s -- with its giant we@@ bs of dark matter and myster@@ i@@ ous g@@ ap@@ ing vo@@ ids -- got built this way .
you get st@@ ressed , you do some medi@@ tation .
we need an exercise . we need a frame@@ work to learn how to be more min@@ d@@ ful .
it does hurt . and we rein@@ force the story@@ line , right ?
and he actually took one look at my squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly line , and said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just embra@@ ce the sha@@ ke ? &quot;
what if i could only create with a dollar &apos;s worth of supp@@ lies ?
it did not happen over@@ night .
so i was fil@@ ming .
and when i made my way to that pi@@ ping ch@@ im@@ ney i &apos;d seen in the distance , i saw han@@ na za@@ vor@@ ot@@ n@@ ya , and i met her .
i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil .
i em@@ body the central parado@@ x .
parents text and do email at break@@ fast and at dinner while their children com@@ pla@@ in about not having their parents &apos; full attention .
but what might feel just right for that midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged ex@@ ecu@@ tive can be a problem for an ad@@ oles@@ cent who needs to develop fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face relationships .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
and we are vulnerable .
so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
make room for it .
let &apos;s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
the master said , &apos; tho@@ u di@@ d@@ st thy best , that is success . &apos; &quot; from those things , and one other perhaps , i co@@ ined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind at@@ tain@@ ed only through self-@@ satis@@ fac@@ tion in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
and that &apos;s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mo@@ od .
i think our tenden@@ cy is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &apos;t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
and you can win when you &apos;re out@@ sc@@ or@@ ed .
i &apos;ve had some that could and wouldn &apos;t , and i &apos;ve had some that would and couldn &apos;t .
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requ@@ ir@@ ing an organ has dou@@ bled , while in the same time , the actual number of transplan@@ ts has bar@@ ely gone up .
li@@ ver cells , ner@@ ve cells , pan@@ crea@@ tic cells -- we still can &apos;t grow them even today .
we then place it in an o@@ ven@@ -@@ like device , and we &apos;re able to create that structure and bring it out .
and then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
that &apos;s actually the actual prin@@ ter right now , and that &apos;s been prin@@ ting this kid@@ ney structure that you see here .
i became the cap@@ tain of the team , and that was great .
i pulled them asi@@ de .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropri@@ ately called swa@@ p@@ tree , and there were over 5@@ 9@@ ,@@ 300 it@@ em@@ s that i could inst@@ antly swa@@ p for my copy of &quot; 24 . &quot;
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passi@@ ve consum@@ ers to cre@@ ators , to highly en@@ ab@@ led collabor@@ ators .
these four dri@@ vers are f@@ using together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hyper@@ -@@ consumption , towards the 21@@ st century , defined by collabor@@ ative consumption .
these three systems are coming together , allo@@ wing people to share resources without sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ cing their lifest@@ y@@ les , or their cher@@ ished personal free@@ dom@@ s .
this is fu@@ el@@ ing a massive shift from where us@@ age tr@@ um@@ ps pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons -- or as kev@@ in kel@@ ly , the edi@@ tor of wired magazine , puts it , &quot; where access is better than ow@@ ner@@ ship . &quot;
my name is jo@@ se@@ ph , a member of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent in kenya .
the leader of the ch@@ ie@@ fs said , &quot; no , sorry . we can &apos;t take you . you &apos;ll slow us down .
i &apos;m asking my friends from america to help with bringing nur@@ ses or doctors to help us out .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tor@@ na@@ do hit , playing with the tor@@ na@@ do display .
co : you got my number off the news ?
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
mo : data .
in our home@@ town , we trained a hal@@ f-@@ do@@ zen resi@@ dents to run these web tools on their own .
and i met juli@@ us the last week that i was living in ki@@ ber@@ a .
&apos;@@ in case you o@@ we one month , the land@@ l@@ ord will come with his hen@@ ch@@ men and b@@ und@@ le you out . he will con@@ fis@@ cate your things , &apos; arm@@ strong said .
this is perhaps the most primi@@ tive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find in ki@@ ber@@ a , little more than a sti@@ ck@@ -@@ and-@@ mu@@ d hu@@ t next to a g@@ arb@@ age hea@@ p .
it &apos;s on very ste@@ ep ground .
one is people need a guar@@ an@@ tee they won &apos;t be evi@@ cted .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
i don &apos;t know where juli@@ an mor@@ row got that from .
see it up there ?
one is another american inv@@ ent@@ or ted h@@ enter .
many web@@ sites we can &apos;t read using ja@@ ws and the other technologies .
i think i have to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye now .
interest@@ ingly enough , other neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tan@@ gles of mis@@ fol@@ ded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases , not just alzheimer &apos;s disease .
i &apos;m going to ignor@@ e their cau@@ tions and make one very specific for@@ ec@@ ast .
so this is a time of great fl@@ our@@ ishing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physi@@ c@@ ist free@@ man dy@@ son , is not hyper@@ bo@@ le at all .
and to make them really stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical , let &apos;s make them both white guys .
and if you find yourself worried that something like a guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed income is going to stif@@ le our drive to succe@@ ed and make us kind of com@@ plac@@ ent , you might be interested to know that social mo@@ bility , one of the things we really pri@@ de ourselves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very gener@@ ous social safety nets .
the reali@@ ties of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more wid@@ ely known .
i have become more and more un@@ comfortable with this perception of god over the years .
some have conclu@@ ded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
in the second verse comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves o@@ be@@ y him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the great pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t-@@ master or the tri@@ b@@ al prote@@ ctor ?
what if god is in things ?
how could one practice such a faith ?
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
and if we study those h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er tri@@ bes and the ne@@ anderth@@ al , which are very similar to early man , we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology , and this is a kind of a cur@@ ve of their average age .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a m@@ clu@@ han sense , an ex@@ ternal sto@@ mach , in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise .
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has its roots deeply into the co@@ smo@@ s .
it &apos;s a bran@@ ching off from the human form .
i think that really leads no@@ where .
that &apos;s what we get from technology all the time . that &apos;s why people leave villa@@ ges and go into cities , is because they are always gravi@@ tat@@ ing towards increas@@ ed choices and possibilities .
mean@@ while , i had grown up around a lot of teachers .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
that was just my one thing -- i said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s heads .
and we found ourselves full every day with kids .
the key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ shoul@@ der , next to one student , concent@@ r@@ ated attention , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-@@ expression , is going to be absolutely transforma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
they work under the teacher &apos;s gui@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
and so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . this is near the plan@@ ks .
they didn &apos;t want to sell pi@@ rate supp@@ lies .
so this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours .
anyway . so i &apos;m going to jump ahead .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
you see , i grew up in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
this is where we conc@@ ei@@ ve of ra@@ pe and cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties as inevi@@ t@@ abilities .
there is a side that fi@@ ghts , and there is a side that kee@@ ps the schools and the fac@@ tor@@ ies and the hospitals open .
a con@@ gol@@ ese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her ra@@ ped in front of them and mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in front of them , and her children saw their nin@@ e-@@ year-old si@@ bling killed in front of them , how they &apos;re doing okay right now .
za@@ in@@ ab sal@@ bi : women , war@@ time and the dream of peace
and she has this show , &quot; the simple life . &quot;
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a , man .
and she &apos;s very important in my life , because she &apos;s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
so if you compare comple@@ xi@@ ties to simpli@@ city , it &apos;s also cat@@ ching up in a way , too .
and when you &apos;re told this , you feel kind of weird .
so , i went back to the computer , and i bought five large fri@@ es , and scan@@ ned them all . and i was looking for some kind of food theme , and i wrote some software to auto@@ matically lay out fren@@ ch@@ -@@ fr@@ y images .
it &apos;s a bit e@@ er@@ ie , isn &apos;t it ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think .
environmental challenges fall into the same three categ@@ ories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous waste du@@ mp@@ s . but there are also regi@@ onal environmental problems , like ac@@ id rain from the mid@@ west to the nor@@ the@@ ast , and from western europe to the arc@@ tic , and from the mid@@ west out the miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i into the dead zone of the gul@@ f of mexico .
you all know that . at the last i@@ p@@ c@@ c sum@@ mary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; how certain are you ? &quot; they wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
we have to have a uni@@ fied view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting weal@@ thy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has pres@@ ented us with a choice -- just as j@@ ill &#91; bol@@ te &#93; ta@@ yl@@ or was fig@@ uring out how to save her life while she was di@@ stra@@ cted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
so they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whi@@ che@@ ver of them is ele@@ cted -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when i came back from k@@ yo@@ to in 199@@ 7 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that break@@ through there , and then con@@ fron@@ ted the united states sen@@ ate , only one out of 100 sen@@ ators was willing to vote to con@@ fir@@ m , to ra@@ ti@@ fy that treat@@ y . whatever the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es say has to be la@@ id al@@ on@@ g@@ side what the people say .
a change in commit@@ ment . a new sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy .
and this exhi@@ bi@@ tion is about the work of designers that help us be more el@@ a@@ stic , and also of designers that really work on this el@@ a@@ sti@@ city as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
he &apos;s thinking -- of course it &apos;s all a concept -- of inje@@ cting ty@@ pe@@ faces into sper@@ ma@@ to@@ zo@@ a , i don &apos;t know how to say it in english -- sper@@ ma@@ ta@@ zo@@ i -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole po@@ em written with every e@@ jac@@ u@@ lation .
in this particular case a section will be de@@ vot@@ ed to information design .
ra@@ pid manufacturing is a computer fi@@ le sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .
another shape is made for cancer .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and m@@ our@@ ning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
we did it in three steps .
and the same pattern emer@@ ged in each conflict .
so what &apos;s going on ?
the opposite happened .
and within je@@ wish teach@@ ings , the rab@@ bin@@ ic teach@@ ings , we have hil@@ le@@ l , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn &apos;t exist .
and that unity is something that conne@@ cts all of creation .
and he rus@@ hed home . and after the s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h , he made 12 lo@@ a@@ ves of bread , took them to the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , went into the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , opened the ar@@ k and said , &quot; god , i don &apos;t know why you want this bread , but here you are . &quot;
and he called the two of them to his office .
it per@@ si@@ sts for months and o@@ f@@ ten@@ times for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
but the worst part was , not the spon@@ tane@@ ous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
we treat these patients in a rather cru@@ de fashion at this point in time .
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
so it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosau@@ r@@ -@@ kil@@ ler for 65 million years . they &apos;re very rare .
now the good news is that the od@@ ds of it actually pas@@ sing through this key@@ hole and hit@@ ting us next go@@ -@@ around are one in a million , roughly -- very , very low od@@ ds , so i personally am not lying a@@ wake at night wor@@ rying about this at all .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do .
this probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rock@@ ets .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
and we all had all of that on ta@@ pes .
it &apos;s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it .
you see ban@@ ks -- i don &apos;t know if there are any bank@@ ers over here ; i apo@@ logi@@ ze in ad@@ v@@ ance -- but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
just quickly on the results .
he goes and sees the gover@@ nor . the gover@@ nor says , bor@@ is ni@@ kol@@ a@@ ye@@ v@@ ich , i understand you are doing a great job , and you are the most respe@@ cted newspaper in our distri@@ ct .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last s@@ ession we had about africa and his hypo@@ the@@ tical 50 billion dollars dest@@ ined for africa .
now we do da@@ y@@ dre@@ aming in 11 : 30 with 5@@ 5 seconds left .
what happens to matter if you cho@@ p it up very fine ?
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us , and so on .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
it &apos;s a very simple example .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
it &apos;s the same theory of gravity .
pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , they mean something super@@ natural .
how true for lincol@@ n .
so then he surprised the nation with an up@@ set vic@@ tory for the pres@@ iden@@ cy over three far more experienced , far more educ@@ ated , far more cele@@ br@@ ated ri@@ v@@ als .
but even in his wil@@ dest dreams , lincol@@ n could never have imag@@ ined how far his repu@@ tation would reach .
but it was not to be that simple .
a vic@@ tor in a thousand con@@ tests , three great civil rights laws , medi@@ care , aid to education .
one of his favorite stories , for example , had to do with the revolution@@ ary war hero , e@@ than allen .
and i was so excited -- first person i &apos;d ever see outside of e@@ b@@ be@@ ts field .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , my first conf@@ ession -- to a base@@ ball@@ -@@ lo@@ ving pri@@ est !
and i want to begin with one ep@@ iso@@ de from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar &apos;s fe@@ ast -- because we &apos;re talking about the ir@@ an-@@ iraq war of 5@@ 3@@ 9 b@@ c .
and what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quar@@ ters of the world going to do ?
it was the largest em@@ pi@@ re the world had known until then .
no other evidence .
and equ@@ ally , he &apos;d have been surprised that he was acting under orders from mar@@ du@@ k .
they want to bor@@ row the cy@@ rus cy@@ lin@@ der .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object fig@@ ures .
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
for those without dis@@ abilities , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated according to age and gender , they are arb@@ it@@ r@@ arily separ@@ ated from their si@@ bl@@ ings , often without even a chance to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
people need to know the har@@ m that institutions cause to children , and the better alterna@@ tives that exist .
because it &apos;s obviously incredibly fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
and that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21@@ st of september as the date of peace .
and just sta@@ ying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really em@@ power@@ ing actually .
it didn &apos;t matter if it didn &apos;t create a day of peace .
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
it was histor@@ ical . could it work in afghanistan with un@@ ama and who and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
and we did , and we travel@@ ed around , and we spoke to el@@ ders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nur@@ ses , we held press con@@ fer@@ ences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with is@@ a@@ f , we sat down with na@@ to , we sat down with the u.k. government .
and we gave the film over .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
it &apos;s about your const@@ it@@ u@@ en@@ cies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
but let &apos;s play along .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that &apos;s not a fair compar@@ ison to make , given that we know that we are not ro@@ dents .
when you eat like a pri@@ mate , you can &apos;t afford both .
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
i &apos;m fascin@@ ated with the idea of what happens when you mer@@ ge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to re@@ program biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
it &apos;s a very logi@@ cal plan , but it was not always like this .
but one day , something happened .
the man , his name was ma@@ h@@ mou@@ d , and the child , whose name was ra@@ f@@ i , left .
it &apos;s not a pri@@ ority . &quot;
the st@@ um@@ p or cast pro@@ s@@ thesis was made , and he was starting the real physical re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tation .
no need of sta@@ ying with me all the day pus@@ hing my wheel@@ chair . &quot;
i don &apos;t want them to be te@@ ased at school by the other students . &quot;
but with na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , we cannot disc@@ uss .
they are 7@@ ,000 every year -- people coming for the first time .
this is my big wish .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
their decisions , their actions matter .
what lessons would you take from an experience like this ?
and i was part of that .
now , i was a little sc@@ ared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
and he sig@@ ns off , &quot; thank you . &quot;
it says a lot about her pe@@ ers who ele@@ cted her .
can you see it ?
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habit@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much total light it recei@@ ves and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-@@ energy radiation , the u@@ v and the x-@@ ra@@ ys that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this bat@@ h of high-@@ energy radiation .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psych@@ ic , ma@@ gical power@@ s that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the de@@ ce@@ ased .
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
&quot; did he ever have an electric ra@@ z@@ or ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because i &apos;m a go@@ d@@ less person .
now folks , this is not just a metaphor i &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true .
those are very important , cri@@ tically important to us .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y skep@@ tic james rand@@ i takes a f@@ at@@ al do@@ se of home@@ op@@ ath@@ ic sle@@ eping p@@ ills on@@ stage , ki@@ cking off a se@@ aring 18@@ -@@ minute indi@@ ct@@ ment of ir@@ rational belie@@ fs . he thro@@ ws out a challenge to the world &apos;s psych@@ ics : prove what you do is real , and i &apos;ll give you a million dollars .
so it runs frequ@@ ently , the entire hospital , just on a gener@@ ator .
there has to be something better . &quot;
but this gives control to the provi@@ der , whether there &apos;s power or not , because they can ad@@ just the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they &apos;re giving their patient .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
some lo@@ gos designed by my students .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as po@@ tent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
it &apos;s a h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st of a different kind , and hi@@ ding under our des@@ ks isn &apos;t going to help .
now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it &apos;s not the ingre@@ di@@ ents in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
half the people who developed the food pyrami@@ d have ties to agri@@ business .
mar@@ gar@@ ine didn &apos;t exist .
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere .
most mom@@ s coo@@ ked like mine : a piece of bro@@ iled meat , a quickly made sal@@ ad with bot@@ t@@ led d@@ res@@ sing , can@@ ned sou@@ p , can@@ ned fru@@ it sal@@ ad .
leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
and i say this as a man who has e@@ aten a fair share of cor@@ ned bee@@ f in his life .
we can continue the search for the ingre@@ di@@ ents we love , and we can continue to sp@@ in y@@ ar@@ ns about our favorite me@@ als .
sound familiar ?
if i can ask an in@@ dis@@ cre@@ et question , how many of you have tat@@ to@@ os ?
my@@ th number two : or@@ p@@ he@@ us , wonderful guy , char@@ ming to be around , great parti@@ er , great sing@@ er , lo@@ ses his belo@@ ved , char@@ ms his way into the under@@ world , only person to char@@ m his way into the under@@ world , char@@ ms the go@@ ds of the under@@ world , they rele@@ ase his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
some of these have already been tou@@ ched upon by other speak@@ ers , which is encoura@@ ging .
5@@ 2 million people die of natural causes each year cor@@ respon@@ ds , then , to 5@@ 2 million vol@@ um@@ es destro@@ yed .
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we b@@ low ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronom@@ ical .
we were very successful .
so if you think about what it means to learn ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic or to learn to read , you &apos;re actually , literally re@@ writing your own brain .
and they would just st@@ are at us with ba@@ ff@@ le@@ ment when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid mov@@ ements , and they would be really ir@@ ri@@ t@@ ated and wouldn &apos;t see what we were up to .
so then , you move off to this larger sphere of &quot; human + , &quot; and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible mo@@ des of being .
ts : those are perman@@ ent magne@@ ts , yeah .
ts : yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of can@@ v@@ ases .
and then when i did the second one , it really dist@@ ur@@ bed the piece -- these big blue lines cr@@ as@@ hing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of ten@@ sion and an over@@ la@@ p .
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of con@@ fron@@ tation with a sort of dis@@ son@@ ant -- i suppose it &apos;s an electro@@ magnetic force that somehow gover@@ ns your par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of ar@@ c of your whole life .
ts : thank you , john .
my mother comes out , and he as@@ ks her for money , but she doesn &apos;t have enough .
i grew up in the middle of no@@ where on a di@@ rt road in rural ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as , an hour from the ne@@ ar@@ est movie theater .
one of them , i call my mi@@ ma@@ w &apos;s test .
i &apos;m under the river with those fish .
one of these is scrat@@ ch@@ -@@ off ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
and so we got to the gra@@ ve and made this , which was hil@@ ari@@ ous -- the attention that we got .
and also they re@@ ference how the u@@ vul@@ a -- everything they say is fallen because of the for@@ bi@@ dden fru@@ it .
he &apos;s an austr@@ ali@@ an ab@@ original el@@ der , and he &apos;s also an artist .
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
and if you don &apos;t want to fold 400 sc@@ ales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add pl@@ ates to the back of a tur@@ tle , or to@@ es .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one fla@@ p .
and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .
to@@ es have become an origami me@@ me , because everyone &apos;s doing it .
they certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
the problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and she@@ et@@ -@@ like at its dest@@ ination , but needs to be small for the journey .
for@@ rest north : the beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation .
he came up with our name and lo@@ go . we &apos;re mission mot@@ ors .
the 200@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why i talk about the &quot; end of men . &quot;
and so they decided , because they were intri@@ gu@@ ed by this finding , to do a nation@@ wide survey .
but that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
and what &apos;s even more dist@@ ur@@ bing is what &apos;s happening with yo@@ unger boys .
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t rever@@ se themselves without a lot of pain , and that &apos;s why i talk about us all going through this together .
but over the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s , the south korea government decided they wanted to rapi@@ dly industri@@ alize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the work@@ force .
and we have a lot of sk@@ ill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to pre@@ p@@ are to get through that glass cei@@ ling ?
and the man who talked at that ev@@ ening lec@@ ture was very interesting .
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civili@@ zations that we look up to as having been p@@ inn@@ ac@@ les of human achie@@ vement -- whether it &apos;s china , gre@@ e@@ ce , the hin@@ du civilization , or the may@@ as , or eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans -- what we know about them is really about their ec@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their everyday life .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappe@@ ars , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
and the number of us who live outside the old nation@@ -@@ state categ@@ ories is increasing so quickly , by 6@@ 4 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your be@@ ar@@ ings when you &apos;re in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and i sat down , and i began to write , and write , and write , even though i &apos;d gone there really to get away from my des@@ k .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i &apos;ve done during my first five ted@@ talks .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging econom@@ ies , we call them .
will they move on ?
the whole emerging world jo@@ ins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poor@@ est billion .
the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poor@@ est can we check population growth . this is the parado@@ x@@ ical answer that h@@ ans ro@@ s@@ ling un@@ v@@ ei@@ ls at ted @ can@@ nes using color@@ ful new data display technology .
we are left with this missing space of increas@@ ed dea@@ ths the further north you go .
and i started doing research , and we found , very exc@@ it@@ ingly , that the skin produ@@ ces ni@@ tri@@ c o@@ xide .
now , what we were care@@ ful to do was , vi@@ tam@@ in d is made by ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let b ra@@ ys and we wanted to separate our story from the vi@@ tam@@ in d story .
there is no change in blood flow , in di@@ lat@@ ation of the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
and this is on@@ going work , but der@@ mat@@ ologists -- i mean , i &apos;m a der@@ mat@@ ologist .
these are major issues .
so , your body is constantly re@@ gener@@ ating .
it dis@@ integr@@ ates a few months later .
and this is an x-@@ ray showing you the patent , func@@ tional blood ves@@ sel .
but there are other hol@@ low organs that have ad@@ ded complexity to it .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use dec@@ ell@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed organs .
we are limited with di@@ stances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those di@@ stances over time .
he finally st@@ ops the run@@ away stage .
i would be willing to bet that i &apos;m the du@@ m@@ best guy in the room because i couldn &apos;t get through school . i strug@@ gl@@ ed with school .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn &apos;t do : don &apos;t hit ; don &apos;t bi@@ te ; don &apos;t swe@@ ar .
all three of the fo@@ under@@ s of net@@ scap@@ e had it .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i remember this one custom@@ er so vi@@ vi@@ dly because i also did some other stuff with these cli@@ ents .
i also learned , don &apos;t reve@@ al your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my com@@ ics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you could stuff p@@ ins in them .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 7@@ 0-@@ year-old women playing bridge .
that was cool because then i had re@@ tail out@@ lets .
and then they don &apos;t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the sk@@ ill of negoti@@ ating , and they learn the sk@@ ill of finding opportunities as well .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad custom@@ er service , show them what bad custom@@ er service looks like .
it &apos;s a video that was done by one of the companies that i ment@@ or .
we have even managed to make the study of liter@@ ature ar@@ can@@ e .
a har@@ ro@@ wing predi@@ le@@ ction for the uses of force had become common@@ place , with an equal di@@ sta@@ ste for the alternative forms of influence .
but structures designed to connect , rather than divi@@ de mu@@ tu@@ ally depen@@ dent cir@@ cles , rather than isol@@ ating tri@@ an@@ gles .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreci@@ ate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between compe@@ ting goods .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
they are acting in the sense that they &apos;re em@@ ul@@ ating the original ma@@ sh@@ up .
in the good old days when this republi@@ can ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about open@@ ness .
you could still buy the music , but you couldn &apos;t hear anything because it had been sil@@ enced .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
if you don &apos;t say the right creative thing , you &apos;re going to be jud@@ ged .
and something else happened , these people who went through the process and tou@@ ched the sna@@ ke ended up having less an@@ x@@ iety about other things in their lives .
about that time he was at the d.@@ school at stanford taking clas@@ ses .
so while you &apos;re sitting around with the other patients in your pa@@ jam@@ as and everybody &apos;s p@@ ale and thin and you &apos;re waiting for your turn to get the gam@@ ma ra@@ ys , you think of a lot of things .
thank you .
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on in different space types in this building .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quanti@@ ta@@ tive way how his design choices im@@ pac@@ ted the ec@@ ology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it ad@@ ded a new dimension to what he did .
so let &apos;s just run through these guys .
the system was designed to aug@@ ment human intelligence , it was called .
these are some examples of this system in action in the late 8@@ 0s .
and according to fortun@@ e magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
in fact , someone on re@@ dd@@ it thought , &quot; oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
they even created an e-@@ card so you could send your friend a dan@@ cing sp@@ las@@ h@@ y .
i am a na@@ tive of bur@@ kin@@ a fas@@ o .
fund@@ raising was not an easy task .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
i would like to share with you this .
yes , you know it .
and when you look through them , you get a gli@@ mp@@ se into the mind of the cyber@@ -@@ illu@@ sion@@ ist .
voice : don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of chinese civilization .
the chinese have a very , very different con@@ ception of race to most other countries .
it &apos;s had no serious ri@@ v@@ als .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
first , the west is rapi@@ dly losing its influence in the world .
now this is the way things are going to move , because china has a very specific problem , which is different from europe and different from the united states : china has huge numbers of people and no space .
red = dru@@ ms , blue = b@@ ass , green = ch@@ or@@ ds , orange = leads , pur@@ ple = pa@@ ds the mou@@ th@@ piece consi@@ sts of ...
it &apos;s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a law@@ yer .
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; big sister w@@ ong , &quot; was@@ h@@ burn , w@@ ong , same difference .
what about art ?
everyone was gl@@ u@@ ed to the tv , watching dist@@ ur@@ bing , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic we heard in the media .
people come around us and start asking , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
i just obser@@ ved .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
we went to africa , sud@@ an , si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , liber@@ ia , kenya .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside .
for each project we do a film .
but yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; look , you &apos;re going to have to te@@ ar it down .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neu@@ tra@@ l place for ex@@ changes and discus@@ sions , and then en@@ ables you to change the world .
and we come from a long tradition of sharing .
one of the fo@@ under@@ s went to swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , saw it imple@@ mented some@@ place , said , &quot; wow , that looks really cool .
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent .
so here we have lu@@ d@@ ot@@ ru@@ ck , which is in l@@ .@@ a. , doing the things that g@@ our@@ met food tru@@ cks do , and they &apos;ve gather@@ ed quite a following .
super fun , and it happens in a very transi@@ tional neighborhood .
the future , as we know it , is very un@@ predic@@ table .
we &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &apos;ve seen it in the pan@@ de@@ mic flu .
but will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? are we head@@ ed for a new eu@@ gen@@ ics ?
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 20@@ 30 , to destro@@ y the planet , to w@@ re@@ ck everything , through the creation , for example , of a bi@@ op@@ a@@ tho@@ gen .
i &apos;m not on top of the class .
but , most importantly , while i was travel@@ ing , i taught children carto@@ oning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spon@@ tane@@ ous .
i was h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to inclu@@ de this in my pres@@ entation because this carto@@ on was published soon after 9 / 11 .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
this is a work , a library i designed for the ro@@ bin hood foundation .
so then i said , &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot;
we had fashion designers , instal@@ lation artists , models , we had ma@@ ke@@ up artists , je@@ wel@@ ry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my we@@ d@@ ding an art instal@@ lation .
my works also turned auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal .
you know i sat at home and i watched .
and i dre@@ w it out for her .
e : ach@@ o@@ o !
can you get down ?
because one of her favorite folks from back home is here , and she &apos;s pretty nervous to meet him .
e : qu@@ ack , qu@@ ack , qu@@ ack .
sw : you are very special . what would you like to say to all these nice people ?
and on one particular day , the cam@@ pers were jum@@ ping through inner tu@@ bes , they were di@@ ving through inner tu@@ bes . and i thought this would be great fun .
i started see@@ king out tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes because i found that li@@ fel@@ ong swi@@ mm@@ ers often couldn &apos;t teach what they did .
the head is held in line with the sp@@ ine , so that you use strate@@ gic water pressure to raise your legs up -- very important , especially for people with lower body fat .
so i thought why not pun@@ ish myself ? i &apos;ll do japanese .
and that set me on this pan@@ ic driven search for the perfect language method .
and so i ended up walking like this .
i intervie@@ wed these people because they all taught in bu@@ en@@ os air@@ es .
that &apos;s just one benefit of that .
what i want to talk about today is one idea .
now not surpris@@ ingly , that influ@@ enced some people to think we were onto something .
ge@@ off mul@@ gan : a short in@@ tr@@ o to the studio school
and the phili@@ st@@ ine who is sent down , their mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or , is a giant .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the under@@ dog , right ?
if you go back over the history of ancient war@@ f@@ are , you will find time and time again that sl@@ ing@@ ers were the decisi@@ ve factor against in@@ fan@@ try in one kind of battle or another .
and then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes go@@ li@@ ath to re@@ act to the sight of david .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
and something fe@@ ster@@ ed inside me after this happened .
we have millions of genes of micro@@ bes in our human micro@@ bi@@ ome co@@ vering us .
and so , these studies have docum@@ ented or suggest@@ ed out of a variety of important fun@@ ctions for the micro@@ bi@@ al community , this cloud , the non-@@ pa@@ tho@@ gens that live in and on us .
we should treat it carefully and with respect , and we do not want to m@@ ess with it , say by c@@ -@@ se@@ ctions or by antibio@@ tics or exc@@ essi@@ ve cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess , without some real good justi@@ fication .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . so wikipedia -- you just saw the little demon@@ stration of it -- it &apos;s a fre@@ ely licen@@ sed en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia . it &apos;s written by thousands of volunte@@ ers all over the world in many , many languages .
and he &apos;s only been our employe@@ e since janu@@ ary 2005 , all the other growth before that .
the media has covered this some@@ what exten@@ si@@ vely .
we should mer@@ ely report on what repu@@ table par@@ ties have said about it .
these are the people who are doing the bul@@ k of the site , and they are , in a sense , se@@ mi@@ -@@ profession@@ als at what they &apos;re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality .
so somebody says , &quot; d@@ ele@@ te it , please . d@@ ele@@ te it -- it &apos;s not not@@ able . &quot;
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
ben sa@@ under@@ s : yeah , hi , ben sa@@ under@@ s .
i and my colleagues art ar@@ on and lu@@ cy brown and others , have put 3@@ 7 people who are ma@@ dly in love into a func@@ tional mr@@ i brain scan@@ ner .
almost nobody gets out of love alive .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the vent@@ ral te@@ g@@ mental area .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
i &apos;ve also come to believe that roman@@ tic love is an addi@@ ction : a perfectly wonderful addi@@ ction when it &apos;s going well , and a perfectly horri@@ ble addi@@ ction when it &apos;s going poor@@ ly .
our ne@@ west experiment has been hat@@ ched by my collea@@ gue , art ar@@ on -- putting people who are repor@@ ting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the func@@ tional mr@@ i .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
i &apos;m not quite sure .
three : sin@@ e@@ w used in the ou@@ ter layer of the lim@@ b for ma@@ x@@ im@@ um ten@@ sion stor@@ age .
d@@ ong wo@@ o j@@ ang : the art of bo@@ w-@@ making
and like all the dolph@@ ins in our community , we photograph@@ ed mu@@ gs@@ y and tra@@ cked her little spo@@ ts and ni@@ cks in her dor@@ sal f@@ in , and also the unique spot patterns as she ma@@ tured over time .
and they use these bur@@ st-@@ pul@@ sed sounds as well as their head@@ -@@ to-@@ head behaviors when they &apos;re fighting .
this under@@ water key@@ board in or@@ land@@ o , florida , at the ep@@ co@@ t center , was actually the most sophisti@@ cated ever two-@@ way interface designed for humans and dolph@@ ins to work together under the water and exchange information .
the di@@ ver here has a rop@@ e to@@ y , and i &apos;m on the key@@ board on the left , and i &apos;ve just played the rop@@ e key , and that &apos;s the requ@@ est for the to@@ y from the human .
the dolph@@ in &apos;s at the key@@ board .
den@@ ise her@@ zing : could we speak the language of dolph@@ ins ?
it &apos;s based on an ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ an rhyth@@ m called &quot; car@@ ni@@ v@@ ali@@ to . &quot;
comm@@ ent@@ ator : there he is .
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the v@@ ec@@ tor and increase the time .
because this is -- i &apos;m quite an experienced man@@ ager of systems as a pilot , but this is really -- you need flu@@ i@@ di@@ ty , you need to be agi@@ le and also to ada@@ pt really fast .
so i did try to take , again , a clim@@ b al@@ titude .
with that , i have to ada@@ pt to something new .
y@@ r : i have a standard answer .
i bet those pre@@ histor@@ ic ca@@ ve artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
wor@@ r@@ y@@ ingly , there is no con@@ sen@@ su@@ s about what it is .
we don &apos;t see those nuclear re@@ actions in stars .
so we percei@@ ve nothing as what it really is .
why a marriage contra@@ ct and not any other reason for regular an@@ nu@@ al action ?
it &apos;s the basic regul@@ ating principle of the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
so this little slide here shows you an op@@ tom@@ e@@ tr@@ ist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ra@@ ti@@ o in the u.@@ k .
i have a global vision for vision .
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
so , the new festi@@ val , it as@@ ks the audience to play an essential role in sha@@ ping the performance .
case in point : when &quot; the su@@ l@@ tan &apos;s eleph@@ ant &quot; came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a lon@@ don@@ er wrote , &quot; for the first time since the london bom@@ b@@ ings , my daughter called up with that spar@@ kle back in her voice .
&#91; &quot; acade@@ my a@@ ward w@@ inner for visual effects &quot; &#93; second doctor : wel@@ come to your new body , ja@@ ke@@ .@@ first doctor : good .
and what these images are -- you &apos;ll see them at the start of the slide show -- there &apos;s only about four images -- but it &apos;s of a little bear that lives in the great bear rain@@ forest .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the gl@@ aci@@ ers in the arc@@ tic are also re@@ ce@@ ding right now to the point that the ice is en@@ ding up on land and not inje@@ cting any ice back into the ecosystem .
after an hour in these conditions , it &apos;s so extreme that , when i go down , almost every di@@ ve i v@@ om@@ it into my regul@@ ator because my body can &apos;t deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
when i &apos;m on my de@@ ath@@ bed , i &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
it just sees this big ballo@@ on in the ocean -- it doesn &apos;t have hands -- it &apos;s going to take a little bi@@ te , the boat po@@ ps , and off they go .
i put my fli@@ p@@ pers on . i could bar@@ ely part my li@@ ps .
this just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
it &apos;s a story that lives deep in my heart , and i &apos;m proud to share this with you .
now that you &apos;re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .
now , instead of doing it like mis@@ direction and thro@@ wing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank inside your head , your little security gu@@ ard , and get you , instead of foc@@ using on your ex@@ ternal senses , just to go intern@@ al for a second .
do you have a wal@@ let on you ? joe : i don &apos;t .
open your hand . thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand .
down here i noticed this . is this something of y@@ ours , sir ?
never have been .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
could we le@@ verage these technologies to switch smar@@ tly whenever you travel from country to country ?
and the local finan@@ cing is not part of the ecosystem for suppor@@ ting hard@@ ware projects .
we need to look for something else , and we &apos;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a ru@@ t .
this last project is also of components .
you can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to , and what kinds of food they like to eat .
and by the matri@@ x , i mean literally the matri@@ x , like the movie &quot; the matri@@ x . &quot;
it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause har@@ m .
i think this is what we come with , at least a prepar@@ e@@ dness to learn all of these things .
notice also that on all of these graph@@ s , the slo@@ pe is ste@@ e@@ per on in-@@ group , auth@@ ority , pu@@ ri@@ ty .
so this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three pan@@ els portra@@ y the ti@@ mel@@ ess truth that order ten@@ ds to deca@@ y .
because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand c@@ any@@ on .
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
can you be not for or against anything ?
what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world -- australia , united states , u.k. and so on -- face in some of the de@@ plo@@ y@@ ments that they &apos;re dealing with in the modern world at this time .
so again , they would say , &quot; well if we have access to non-@@ le@@ th@@ al weapons , if we &apos;ve got someone we know is ho@@ sti@@ le , we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place , at least , again , we &apos;re not going to kill them . &quot;
they generally seem to think , &quot; well , why would we care what &apos;s happened with the police ?
so the next two years were the years they studied -- 2001 , 200@@ 2 .
it was used in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately .
in fact , he was probably six in@@ ches t@@ aller than me , and she was about this t@@ all .
they &apos;re trained to be more re@@ stra@@ ined in the use of force than the military are .
and the question he had is , &quot; can i do it ? can it be done ? &quot;
we have art students getting together , taking old radi@@ ator parts and doing an ir@@ on-@@ po@@ ur to make something new out of it .
they &apos;re a bit sub@@ ver@@ sive in what they do .
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robo@@ tics competi@@ tions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &apos;t , like a little brother into a little sister &apos;s room .
this is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak . where does he learn about computers ?
and dre@@ w bar@@ r@@ y@@ more , for all her wonderful char@@ m , is not glam@@ or@@ ous either .
and this is he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r .
this is fi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ o li@@ pp@@ i &apos;s 15@@ 4@@ 3 portra@@ it of sa@@ int apo@@ ll@@ on@@ ia .
so you can do a glam@@ ori@@ zed picture of a car , but you can &apos;t do a glam@@ ori@@ zed picture of traffic .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
so , this s@@ ession &apos;s supposed to be about p@@ ure pleasure but glamour &apos;s really par@@ tly about meaning .
it was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for glam@@ ori@@ zing violence , because , look -- sun@@ glas@@ ses and those long co@@ ats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
so she &apos;s even more glam@@ or@@ ous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
it was a way of lo@@ c@@ ating myself .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreci@@ ation of my body , the way an ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ ent can sometimes have a moment of kin@@ dness .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop pe@@ eing on her@@ self because so many grown soldiers had sho@@ ved themselves inside her .
and the fire that bur@@ ned in me on day three through six of chem@@ o is the fire that is burning in the fore@@ sts of the world .
it was the hon@@ ey in the water that made it swe@@ et , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was all these things .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
and i@@ van puts his sandwi@@ ch over here , on top of the pi@@ rate ch@@ est .
which sandwi@@ ch is he going to take ?
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
now she thinks the po@@ w@@ der is sugar .
okay , so it causes a small invol@@ un@@ t@@ ary contra@@ ction in my hand by putting a magnetic pul@@ se in my brain .
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about t@@ ms .
that &apos;s a great answer . re@@ bec@@ ca sa@@ x@@ e , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wa@@ ke@@ -up call , doesn &apos;t it , to al@@ ert us to the fact that we &apos;re hur@@ rying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nu@@ b of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and in this , to@@ w@@ ns begin to re@@ think how they organi@@ ze the urban landscape , so that people are encoura@@ ged to slow down and smell the ro@@ ses and connect with one another .
and nor@@ way , swe@@ den , den@@ mark and fin@@ land now r@@ ank among the top six most competi@@ tive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american we@@ ep with en@@ vy .
i think there &apos;s a kind of meta@@ physical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of w@@ all@@ ing ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
i no longer hear time &apos;s win@@ ged ch@@ ari@@ ot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
how do you discover the uni@@ qu@@ eness of a project as unique as a person ?
and when there were com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts about budget , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : refle@@ ctions . &quot;
and i went down and ch@@ ie@@ f minister b@@ ad@@ al said to me , &quot; we si@@ k@@ h@@ s have suff@@ ered a great deal , as you have je@@ ws .
and again , i felt kind of un@@ comfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building -- 5@@ 0,000 square feet -- will sit on that fra@@ gi@@ le h@@ ill and that we will go into g@@ aller@@ ies -- rooms with do@@ ors and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st .
studies for the structure of the roof , which dem@@ ands maybe new materials : how to make it white , how to make it trans@@ lu@@ cent , how to make it glo@@ wing , how to make it not cap@@ ri@@ cious .
so i think i &apos;m going to start with what i just heard .
so i &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
well we &apos;re ja@@ zz musi@@ cians , so stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to fin@@ ance .
na@@ ma@@ ste . sal@@ a@@ am .
i have come from a place of inten@@ se dar@@ k@@ ness .
actually , i come from britain , but i &apos;ve been living in mal@@ di@@ ves for 26 years now .
it comes off the ocean here and is dra@@ wn up towards india .
now , the particular species of dra@@ gon@@ fly i want to talk about is this one , because most dra@@ gon@@ flies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . it can &apos;t travel very far .
and i didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
you &apos;re too ke@@ en . you &apos;re too ke@@ en . no . hang on . hang on .
it stre@@ t@@ ches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s india here .
that &apos;s the inter@@ -@@ mon@@ soon , the time when the mon@@ soon changes .
the lar@@ va@@ e have to develop very quickly .
and the dra@@ gon@@ flies are there . i have repor@@ ts from my various cont@@ acts .
and i only st@@ um@@ bled on this because i was living in mal@@ é , in mal@@ di@@ ves for long enough for it to per@@ col@@ ate into my brain that something rather special was going on .
and they are not the only one that makes the cros@@ sing .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
cham@@ pi@@ on sounds so goo@@ fy , but it &apos;s what it was , right ?
and this one , look how it sli@@ des si@@ de@@ ways , every which way ?
this one , a little sk@@ et@@ ch@@ y going back@@ wards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
and they &apos;re not all bad .
next . and this is something deeper , and this is where i &apos;m — i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the fe@@ yn@@ man bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ es . it was the red one or the blue one .
and so many people , i guess , watch those videos .
but car@@ l norden is really the one who cra@@ cks the code .
so in the years leading up to the second world war , the u.s. military bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these norden bom@@ b@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 14@@ ,000 each -- again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money .
well how many clou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were above central europe between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
and their mission was to find and to destro@@ y -- remember the sc@@ u@@ d mis@@ si@@ le laun@@ chers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the ira@@ q@@ is were laun@@ ching at the isra@@ eli@@ s ?
in that ex@@ act same period that we &apos;ve been using these dr@@ ones with de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing accu@@ ra@@ cy , the number of attac@@ ks , of su@@ i@@ cide attac@@ ks and terror@@ ist attac@@ ks , against american forces in afghanistan has increas@@ ed ten@@ fold .
and vis@@ iting some pretty incredible places , places like mon@@ go@@ li@@ a , cam@@ bo@@ dia , new gu@@ ine@@ a , south africa , tanz@@ ania twice -- i was here a month ago .
but that &apos;s not really the question i &apos;m asking .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &quot; well , you know , we seem to come in dis@@ cre@@ et sub-@@ species or categ@@ ories . &quot;
and the whole thing , if you add it all together , is over six billion nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des long .
and what that means is that we origin@@ ated in africa . it &apos;s written in our dna .
now , africa is the most tro@@ pic@@ al continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and cap@@ ri@@ cor@@ n -- and there aren &apos;t a lot of gl@@ aci@@ ers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
we became much more social . the social networks exp@@ and@@ ed .
and it &apos;s based on a few thousand people we &apos;ve sam@@ pl@@ ed from , you know , a hand@@ ful of popu@@ lations around the world .
projects around the world -- docum@@ enting oral poetry in si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , preser@@ ving traditional wea@@ ving patterns in ga@@ za , language re@@ vi@@ tali@@ zation in ta@@ ji@@ ki@@ stan , etc . , etc .
well , the answer seems to be , the universe can create complexity , but with great diffic@@ ul@@ ty .
and at first , it &apos;s just a blu@@ r , but very quickly distin@@ ct things begin to appear in that blu@@ r .
stars will create the gol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks conditions for cros@@ sing two new th@@ res@@ hol@@ ds .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
as it cop@@ ies itself , once in every billion r@@ ung@@ s , there ten@@ ds to be an er@@ ror .
we are bl@@ essed with a language , a system of communication , so powerful and so pre@@ cise that we can share what we &apos;ve learned with such pre@@ c@@ ision that it can accu@@ mu@@ late in the collective memory .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
and then they bl@@ ame the ban@@ ks for being the bad guys who gave them the mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages .
low-@@ income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lot@@ ter@@ ies .
take out those who say they save too little .
or as some econom@@ ists call it , present bi@@ as .
what are the impli@@ cations to saving lives and having organs available ?
it &apos;s very pain@@ ful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
if you &apos;re thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they &apos;re taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
it &apos;s completely fu@@ cked up and can only be expla@@ ined in song .
you &apos;re live .
have a great s@@ ession .
when i go out to direct a film , every day we pre@@ p@@ are too much , we think too much .
and i say , &quot; cate , what do you want to do ? &quot;
so , how far does e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty go ?
we tell ourselves stories .
because she fell in love with wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ...
eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth : bes@@ s ?
eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth : this man has se@@ duced a ward of the queen , and she has married without ro@@ y@@ al con@@ sent .
so how do i start all this ?
they su@@ ck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they dri@@ p feed the lower city .
it is fin@@ ite ; harmon@@ y is infin@@ ite .
i met a guy -- the guy on the left .
we needed to be working on bee@@ f .
this is where we stand today .
we need to use less to make more .
they may have a lot of opini@@ ons about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terri@@ bly in@@ formed .
are we going to work with 1.@@ 5 billion produ@@ cers ?
we need change even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .
we &apos;re using whatever le@@ verage we have to bring them to the table .
it &apos;s more with less and less again .
i am a neuro@@ scientist with a mix@@ ed background in physics and medicine .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
let me sum@@ mar@@ ize : the rat received a paraly@@ zing les@@ i@@ on of the spin@@ al cor@@ d .
they are the result of a young team of very tal@@ ented people : physical therap@@ ists , neuro@@ bi@@ ologists , neuro@@ surge@@ ons , engineers of all kinds , who have achie@@ ved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury can se@@ ver the communication between your brain and your body , leading to paraly@@ sis . fresh from his lab , gr@@ é@@ go@@ ire cour@@ t@@ ine shows a new method -- combin@@ ing drugs , electrical stimu@@ lation and a robot -- that could re-@@ a@@ wa@@ ken the neu@@ ral path@@ ways and help the body learn again to move on its own . see how it works , as a paraly@@ zed rat becomes able to run and navi@@ gate sta@@ irs .
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nur@@ tured by the people around them .
and i think about that today because i am remin@@ ded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of clo@@ sing that gap .
i loved getting as .
because the world is big .
sum@@ mer@@ time and the living is easy fish are jum@@ ping and the c@@ ot@@ ton is high oh , your da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s rich and your ma is goo@@ d-@@ looking so hus@@ h little baby don &apos;t you c@@ ry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
&quot; the human voice : myster@@ i@@ ous , spon@@ tane@@ ous , pri@@ mal . &quot; with these words , sop@@ ran@@ o c@@ lar@@ on mc@@ fa@@ dden invi@@ tes us to explore the myster@@ ies of brea@@ thing and sing@@ ing , as she per@@ forms the challen@@ ging &quot; ari@@ a , &quot; by john c@@ age . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
no ce@@ o , no fir@@ m responsible , sing@@ ly , for building it .
instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see am@@ i@@ d@@ st the fo@@ g the people immediately around us .
how did this happen ?
i am not making this up .
and wikipedia has embra@@ ced this .
but then , you can see the same kind of wh@@ im@@ sy applied to people .
here is the ch@@ art of over 4@@ 3 people helping to ste@@ er the robot that could not ste@@ er and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another .
radical open@@ ness is still a dist@@ ant future in the field of school education .
in red , sort of below o@@ ec@@ d average .
spending per student only explains about , well , less than 20 percent of the performance vari@@ ation among countries , and lux@@ em@@ b@@ our@@ g , for example , the most expensive system , doesn &apos;t do particularly well .
germany , my own country , in the year 2000 , fe@@ at@@ u@@ red in the lower quad@@ rant , below average performance , large social dis@@ par@@ i@@ ties .
it didn &apos;t change its economy . it didn &apos;t change the com@@ posi@@ tions of its population .
high per@@ form@@ ers on p@@ is@@ a embra@@ ce diversity with differ@@ enti@@ ated pe@@ da@@ go@@ gical practic@@ es .
every school succe@@ e@@ ds .
rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years .
there could be all sorts of technologies . and one is cell phones .
so i started looking for any evidence that -- does connec@@ tivity really increase produ@@ c@@ tivity ?
and one of them is the l@@ ac@@ king buying power .
and anyway , to cut the time short -- so i started -- i first went to them and said , &quot; you know , perhaps i could connect all your bran@@ ches and make you more efficient . &quot;
now , about that co@@ w model i talked about .
&quot; poor countries need aid . &quot;
in swe@@ den we read it once and then we went part@@ ying .
18@@ 5@@ 8 in china was the vic@@ tory in the op@@ ium war by the british forces .
but really , really natural so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty was good for japan .
this is the great lea@@ p forward , when china fell down .
you see this enormous ine@@ qu@@ ity in china , in the mid@@ st of fast economic growth .
i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
but the real proje@@ ctions for those ones , i would like to give it like this .
for most of my research career , i &apos;ve been using acceler@@ ators , such as the electr@@ on acceler@@ ator at stanford university , just up the road , to study things on the small@@ est scale .
in fact , this galaxy and every other galaxy appe@@ ars to be em@@ bed@@ ded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .
now , how do we de@@ du@@ ce where the galaxy is ?
we call this gravi@@ ta@@ tional len@@ sing .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these ar@@ cs are not cen@@ ter@@ ed on individual galaxies .
the star@@ t@@ ling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is exp@@ and@@ ing at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
we discovered blu@@ e@@ gr@@ ass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
and what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &apos;t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents thre@@ w them out on the street .
they squ@@ ir@@ t them at each other , which is lo@@ vely and inno@@ cent .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa that has had success in com@@ b@@ ating the epidemic .
we didn &apos;t see anything like that in africa .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expec@@ tan@@ cy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
it &apos;s not the only place we had any interven@@ tions .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really at@@ tribu@@ te that mortality to hiv .
and hiv is actually particularly clo@@ sely lin@@ ked to trans@@ it .
their ex@@ por@@ ts went down a lot in the early 199@@ 0s -- and actually that dec@@ line lines up really , really clo@@ sely with this dec@@ line in new hiv infe@@ ctions .
if i could reve@@ al anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reve@@ al something that we &apos;ve for@@ gotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
and he came up to me and he kno@@ cked .
so the engineer &apos;s bo@@ ss said , &quot; find a way to quie@@ t this train . &quot;
and those bu@@ mp@@ s act like a mag@@ net for water .
and then we wonder why the mem@@ bran@@ e clo@@ gs and why it takes so much electricity .
em@@ bed@@ ding nan@@ op@@ artic@@ les in a material for instance , always .
at bi@@ om@@ i@@ mi@@ c@@ ry gu@@ il@@ d , which is my consu@@ l@@ ting company , we work with ho@@ k architec@@ ts .
and hopefully , with their help , we &apos;ll learn how to live on this earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone .
i go , &quot; why ? &quot;
they bel@@ on@@ ged to boys .
if they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . learn from it .
what you see , if you see the ti@@ tle called &quot; p@@ m &apos;s car held . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you pra@@ y ? &quot;
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
and you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . there was no time to waste .
text : &quot; help ! i &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot;
so let me explain how this works .
and basically , since we rele@@ ased it about three or four years ago , a lot of web@@ sites have started swi@@ t@@ ching from the old cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a where people wa@@ sted their time to the new cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a where people are helping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
imagine you &apos;re using the internet and you see a cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a .
okay , that &apos;s sever@@ in ha@@ cker .
so i &apos;ll just let you read .
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bil@@ ing@@ ual enough to help us trans@@ late .
people really can learn a language with it .
that &apos;s the current business model .
instead of invest@@ ing in a car , we invest in a community .
this pe@@ ers , in@@ c. concept is in a very difficult and complex real@@ m .
so this was a trick to get these two sides .
and i can tell you two great stories .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fi@@ ction just a few years ago .
maybe these people are right . maybe min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing is a bad thing .
a few minutes ago , i li@@ ken@@ ed min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing to a s@@ lot machine you &apos;d never want to play .
and shor@@ tly after , we left the country , and we re@@ turned to swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
i mean , today , sing@@ apo@@ re is a first world country and ghana is not .
so when the ech@@ o of the g@@ uns@@ h@@ ots had l@@ ing@@ ered , it was soon dro@@ w@@ ned by the chan@@ ting of the mo@@ b , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still se@@ arch@@ ing for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vac@@ u@@ um , you know .
the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
and , i mean , everybody in this room -- now , this is 3@@ 50 short years ago .
i was thinking about making my own little rock@@ ets .
it bur@@ ned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other ro@@ cket fu@@ els i had tried , that all had su@@ l@@ fu@@ r in them .
but that ... process is what i think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every auth@@ ority that you &apos;ve ever heard of i -- sometimes you do that , if you &apos;re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it .
they made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bom@@ b to end the whole thing , right ?
but nobody actually demon@@ strated it , right ?
you know , if they said , you know what ?
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that d@@ well in the hidden cor@@ ners of the city .
when i got comfortable in the space , it also felt like a big play@@ ground .
it must have been a very unusual day for him .
they were consi@@ st@@ ently du@@ g as li@@ me@@ stone quar@@ ries and by the 18@@ th century , the ca@@ v@@ ing-@@ in of some of these quar@@ ries posed safety thre@@ ats , so the government or@@ dered rein@@ for@@ cing of the exi@@ sting quar@@ ries and du@@ g new obser@@ vation tun@@ n@@ els in order to monit@@ or and map the whole place .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
and if you can , just scri@@ b@@ ble a pattern .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bul@@ b , and said , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
between australia and here , right , they &apos;ve got summer and we &apos;ve got winter , and what -- does the earth kind of rus@@ h towards the sun at night , and then rus@@ h back again ? i mean , it &apos;s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what &apos;s right and what isn &apos;t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sorts of fields .
so , children are not empty ves@@ sel@@ s , ok ?
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
so as a chem@@ ist , i wanted to say , &quot; hang on . what is going on here ?
you have regu@@ lation ; information is tran@@ scri@@ bed ; cat@@ aly@@ sts are made ; stuff is happening .
so there are two op@@ tions : intelligent design , direct and indi@@ rect -- so god , or my friend .
i need some information , and i need a contain@@ er .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
you &apos;re sitting on cha@@ irs .
because the thing is , we are so ch@@ au@@ v@@ ini@@ stic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &apos;s other things that can happen .
and i will take kenya as an example .
have got these sur@@ ve@@ ys in place in their dat@@ ab@@ ase , then they use advanced mathematical for@@ mul@@ as to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
my ancestors moved to the united states .
here we have a problem .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
that is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a se@@ cular trend which is very strong .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start ri@@ ding on s@@ co@@ ot@@ ers .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by su@@ zu@@ ki .
broke many nor@@ ms of the standard conven@@ tions for the first time .
and nan@@ o was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
we &apos;ve talked about mo@@ bility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
you know something ? this has been achie@@ ved in india .
sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars .
ladies and gentle@@ men , i &apos;d like to end before time .
when the paper bur@@ ned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , &quot; ma@@ shel@@ k@@ ar , like this , if you do not diff@@ use your energi@@ es , if you focus your energi@@ es , you can achieve anything in the world . &quot;
i &apos;d like to share a couple with you today .
so we &apos;re getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of app@@ s they &apos;d like .
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world .
and the reason the effici@@ en@@ cies are so low is these re@@ ac@@ tors operate at pretty low temperature .
the fuel , like i said , is cer@@ am@@ ic inside zir@@ con@@ ium fuel ro@@ ds , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of re@@ ac@@ tors , fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zir@@ con@@ ium cla@@ dd@@ ings on these fuel ro@@ ds , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , ste@@ am , in an o@@ xi@@ di@@ zing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydro@@ gen , and that hydro@@ gen has this explo@@ sive cap@@ ability to rele@@ ase fis@@ sion products .
everybody was really excited about curi@@ osity , and that had this big plu@@ ton@@ ium battery on board that has plu@@ ton@@ i@@ um@@ -@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-@@ en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um fuel of these mol@@ ten s@@ alt re@@ ac@@ tors , which means that the effects would be ne@@ gli@@ gi@@ ble , because you laun@@ ch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activ@@ ate this re@@ actor .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a ser@@ vi@@ ce-@@ based economy .
so much has that happened that i &apos;ve developed a fairly pra@@ tic@@ ed response , which is : i point out that first of all , you have to understand that there is no such thing as an in@@ authenti@@ c experience .
ren@@ der@@ ing auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity -- and the key@@ word is &quot; ren@@ der@@ ing . &quot;
fact is , there &apos;s a general rule : if you don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s fa@@ ke ; if you do like it , it &apos;s fau@@ x .
the ab@@ c network , affec@@ tion@@ ately known in the trade as the t &amp; amp ; a network , right -- that &apos;s not too much j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , is it ?
let me sum@@ mar@@ ize it , for the business people in the audience , with three rules , three basic rules .
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surge@@ on , because it meant working with my hands in a very focused , inten@@ se way .
that &apos;s about that big .
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more over@@ tly ero@@ tic .
but i had a lot of fun .
and your entire body , everything -- your hair , skin , bone , na@@ ils -- everything is made of col@@ lagen .
the mar@@ vel of this information : how do we actually have this biological mechan@@ ism inside our body to actually see this information ?
ima@@ ge-@@ maker alex@@ ander t@@ si@@ ar@@ as shares a powerful medical visu@@ alization , showing human development from con@@ ception to birth and beyond .
because they thought that if you are having a telescop@@ e , you are an astronom@@ er so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescop@@ e .
and we have a cool atmosphere .
this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from super@@ no@@ va@@ e explo@@ sions .
and this is related to the change of the frequ@@ ency of a moving source .
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough .
there can be different ways doing this .
and i thought , &quot; well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
and i &apos;m more of the , &quot; life &apos;s mess@@ y , clean it up , organi@@ ze it and put it into a ben@@ to box . &quot;
the things i can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
so what i did is i took all of the intervie@@ ws where i saw wor@@ thin@@ ess , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
they thought this was fundamental .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
no .
and then we are mis@@ er@@ able , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of be@@ ers and a ban@@ ana nu@@ t mu@@ ff@@ in .
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; look at her , she &apos;s perfect .
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a@@ .@@ m .
and ni@@ ke knows how to get your p@@ ace and distance from just that sen@@ sor .
g@@ ary wol@@ f : the quanti@@ fied self
so , the first set of path@@ ologi@@ es , they end up in the stick man on his ic@@ on , but the rest of them are really what &apos;s important here .
those are things that are different for each m@@ .@@ s. patient .
all open , all available .
years after he &apos;s had these drugs , i learned that everything he did to manage his ex@@ cess s@@ ali@@ va , including some positive side effects that came from other drugs , were making his con@@ sti@@ pa@@ tion worse .
so , this is what happened when p@@ n@@ as published this .
and then we say , &quot; well how do we line them all up ? &quot;
even the ones that believed they were getting better mat@@ ched the contro@@ ls exactly . exactly .
you look at the patients , you can dri@@ ll in all the contro@@ ls , you can look at them , you can ask them .
only 90 days after this , argu@@ ably the greatest discovery of the last century occur@@ red .
to change its state , by the way , takes two vol@@ ts from a milli@@ second pul@@ se .
we said , &quot; could you build this ? &quot;
it &apos;s just wrong .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
so if it &apos;s a cell or a ter@@ mi@@ te or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
i think this is an interesting question .
so this means that , with each eur@@ o he invest@@ ed , he was able to move 26 euro@@ s of market value through the chain of ow@@ ner@@ ship rela@@ tions .
we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction , so the rema@@ ining un@@ known ter@@ rain will be char@@ ted in the future .
if we look at construction and manufacturing , there &apos;s major in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies , energy consumption and exc@@ essi@@ ve labor techniques .
so we can study this as a physical , intui@@ tive model .
these are parts being prin@@ ted with multi-@@ material properties .
these are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways .
now that was che@@ ating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be am@@ y the hurt five year-old little sister , but am@@ y the special un@@ ic@@ or@@ n .
now if you fall below the average on this cur@@ ve , then psych@@ ologists get thri@@ ll@@ ed , because that means you &apos;re either depres@@ sed or you have a dis@@ order , or hopefully both .
suddenly , something that wasn &apos;t even a possibility became a reality .
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night is e@@ lic@@ it drug use .
you &apos;re 3@@ 7 percent better at sal@@ es .
this was how computing began .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like hea@@ ven .
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of cru@@ sty designer , you know , a cru@@ sty designer , like a good -- kind of like a good french bread ?
it la@@ sts forever . it &apos;s a very strange medium .
on the computer , when you move your mouse , that ar@@ row moves around .
he went into a com@@ a .
i began to be very dis@@ interested in computers themselves , so i began to make pain@@ t@@ ings out of pal@@ mp@@ il@@ ots .
this i found , where nature had made a picture for me .
and so i realized it was o@@ .@@ k. to go .
but , in fact , most boys tend to be a certain way , and most girls tend to be a certain way .
video games are not the cause .
i want to write about a tor@@ na@@ do that comes into our house and blo@@ ws all the windows out and ru@@ ins all the fur@@ ni@@ ture and kill@@ s everybody . &quot;
we have a serious com@@ pres@@ sion of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um happening out there .
most of the edu@@ cational games that are out there today are really flas@@ h@@ cards .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero toler@@ ance poli@@ cies .
we will find a surprising and intri@@ gu@@ ing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the hig@@ gs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one tent@@ h of a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the big bang .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
more than how a phenomenon works , theore@@ tical physi@@ ci@@ sts are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
i love paper , and i love technology , and what i do is i make paper inter@@ active .
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather , the lay of the land , and creating things that would let the she@@ ep flow and go where we wanted them to go .
it &apos;s just a colle@@ ction of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play dru@@ ms on .
so thank you very much .
you can walk away , you can just watch as this character stands there in the bl@@ ender and looks at you , or you can actually choose to interact with it .
but we haven &apos;t yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly se@@ am@@ less@@ ly integr@@ ates the two-@@ dimensional world that we &apos;re comfortable in with the three-@@ dimensional sky above us -- that , i don &apos;t know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in .
fortunately , ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty rema@@ ins the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we &apos;re the most proud of with the air@@ craft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continu@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ vari@@ able trans@@ mission and li@@ qui@@ d-@@ based cool@@ ing system that allows us to use an air@@ craft engine in stop@@ -@@ and-@@ go traffic , to a custom@@ -@@ designed ge@@ ar@@ box that power@@ s either the prop@@ eller when you &apos;re flying or the whe@@ els on the ground , to the auto@@ ma@@ ted w@@ ing-@@ fol@@ ding mechan@@ ism that we &apos;ll see in a moment , to crash safety fe@@ atures .
and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight , which was that it was &quot; remark@@ ably un@@ remarkable . &quot;
just fold up the wings and keep going .
now , here is another nai@@ ve adverti@@ sing man &apos;s question again .
so he tried plan b .
tiny little behavi@@ oral economics detail : in it@@ al@@ y , pen@@ al@@ ty points go back@@ wards .
there is a basic view that real value invol@@ ves making things , invol@@ ves labor . it invol@@ ves engineering .
it ta@@ stes great within the bor@@ ders of that country , but absolute shi@@ te if you take it anywhere else .
vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over : new diam@@ ond sh@@ red@@ dies cer@@ e@@ al .
we need to spend more time appreci@@ ating what already exists , and less time ag@@ oni@@ zing over what else we can do .
it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level .
we &apos;re the ones who let the second repli@@ c@@ ator out of its box , and we can &apos;t push it back in .
you see the idea ?
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evol@@ ving and becoming extin@@ ct .
a me@@ me is not equivalent to an idea .
s@@ b : par@@ don ?
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began im@@ it@@ ating , there was a new cop@@ ying process .
and we &apos;re getting there .
the fra@@ ction of those which get a first repli@@ c@@ ator .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy out@@ put for two percent of your body weight ?
and why would they do that ?
it was 25 minutes of absolute ter@@ ror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
through haiti re@@ wired , through build change , architecture for humanity , ai@@ d@@ g , there is the possibility to reach out to 3@@ 0,000 -- 4@@ 0,000 ma@@ sons across the country and create a movement of pro@@ per building .
this is not just in he@@ bre@@ w , by the way .
and i want to give you one example of one of these ir@@ ration@@ ali@@ ties , and i want to talk to you about che@@ ating .
we paid them 10 cents per cor@@ rect question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per cor@@ rect question .
now , ten comm@@ and@@ ments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &quot; why don &apos;t we get people to sign the honor code ? &quot;
but this did not solve the big problem i had with en@@ r@@ on yet , because in en@@ r@@ on , there &apos;s also a social element .
all of the subje@@ cts sitting in the experiment were car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on students .
more generally , i want to tell you something about behavi@@ oral economics .
but if i was to say that they &apos;re both examples of alternative or new forms of cur@@ ren@@ cy in a hyper@@ connected , dat@@ a-@@ driven global economy , you &apos;d probably think i was a little bit bon@@ kers .
&quot; sub-@@ prime pe@@ d@@ aling . &quot; &quot; bar@@ cla@@ ys takes you for a ride . &quot;
so you can buy app@@ s and make pur@@ ch@@ ases within those app@@ s , but you think about ama@@ zon , you look at the trust bar@@ ome@@ ter that i showed you where people are starting to trust businesses , especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments .
and we did a survey that bac@@ ks up the fact that , you know , 45 percent of people in this very cru@@ cial demo@@ graphic in the u.@@ s .
and what i do is i look for simil@@ ari@@ ties and differences in the solutions that they &apos;ve evolved for fundamental biological problems .
it &apos;s easy to b@@ end .
because after about six months of me talking about this , i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the pen@@ is thing .
so something interesting had to be going on .
not just about its gene@@ tics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
and she said , just talk about yourself .
d@@ l : so anyway , we &apos;re running out of time , so i &apos;ll just get to it .
n@@ m : not too fast .
so this is our last number , and we &apos;ll fe@@ ature n@@ at on piano .
as you can see from the pictures , both no@@ am and i had an early fascin@@ ation with first principles , and over the years , as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisti@@ cated , this early a@@ we with the bas@@ ics has only intensi@@ fied .
the people who are attra@@ cted to these cour@@ ses typically have a ha@@ cker ment@@ ality .
so with that , i &apos;d like to say a few words about up@@ gra@@ ding , and share with you a gli@@ mp@@ se from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same characteri@@ stics of self-@@ learning , learning by doing , self-@@ exploration and commun@@ it@@ y-@@ building , and this project de@@ als with k-@@ 12 math education , beginning with early age math , and we do it on tab@@ lets because we believe that math , like anything else , should be taught hands on .
it basically means to be human and to do the right thing .
it would be great if the story ended there .
where does it come from ?
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in war@@ e@@ houses .
markets have changed beyond recogni@@ tion in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisti@@ cated i@@ .@@ t@@ . project ?
and there are certain ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions that should go with those benefits to be placed on the oper@@ ators , and the key one is , of course , that the oper@@ ators pay for everything , including all the inter@@ facing into the public sector .
so it &apos;s small tra@@ des by small people , but it &apos;s very in@@ formed , safe , conven@@ i@@ ent , low-@@ over@@ head and immedi@@ ate .
with every picture , there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deser@@ ve to be told .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjo@@ ys it when mi@@ ster pu@@ tin turns off the gas ta@@ p , because my budget goes up .
but small atoms want to join together , small nu@@ cle@@ i want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards ir@@ on .
but fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &apos;ve got a neu@@ tr@@ on , so you can make that happen .
and just down the road , this is je@@ t .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
the sig@@ ns don &apos;t look good , some have said .
the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an people , and many other arab@@ s who &apos;ve revol@@ ted and are in transition , have very high expec@@ tations of the government .
what this means is that human development , not se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation , is what &apos;s key to women &apos;s em@@ power@@ ment in the trans@@ forming middle east .
we &apos;ve also found an un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequence .
because i &apos;m not really comfortable just helping that girl with coun@@ sel@@ ing and refer@@ r@@ als .
when nan@@ cy lu@@ bli@@ n started tex@@ ting teen@@ a@@ gers to help with her social ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy organization , what she found was sho@@ cking -- they started tex@@ ting back about their own problems , from bu@@ ll@@ ying to depression to ab@@ use . so she &apos;s setting up a tex@@ t-@@ only crisis line , and the results might be even more important than she expected .
fer@@ din@@ and fo@@ ch , a french army general cre@@ di@@ ted with having one of the most original and sub@@ tle minds in the french army , said , &quot; air@@ planes are interesting to@@ ys , but of no military value . &quot;
and it &apos;s poin@@ ted at the hy@@ person@@ ic gli@@ der .
many prototyp@@ es cr@@ as@@ hed -- many .
from the small@@ est wis@@ p of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s stor@@ ms .
it allows us to contribu@@ te and to be heard as individuals .
dou@@ bt and fear always cre@@ ep in .
yeah , it also went into the pacific .
the folks at a@@ ero@@ viron@@ ment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the a@@ vi@@ on@@ ics .
i work with some of the most amazing people .
and there is no way , and no pro@@ of of arri@@ val .
this story began four years ago .
i &apos;m used to algorith@@ ms and data structures and super motiv@@ ated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a ra@@ ging , violent ad@@ oles@@ cent in the middle of no@@ where .
when he was eight , someone put him on a boat in o@@ des@@ sa and sent him , shi@@ pped him to israel on his own .
i tell kids when they struggle through some u@@ ph@@ ill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignor@@ e the immedi@@ ate ob@@ stac@@ les and raise your head and look around and see how the vi@@ st@@ a around you gro@@ ws .
now i remember , when he said it , i felt goo@@ se@@ bu@@ mp@@ s on my body , because he said it over@@ looking the mo@@ ab mountains here in the background .
what is real is separ@@ at@@ eness , and at some point in early bab@@ y@@ hood , the idea of self starts to form .
it has an extremely important function .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot;
the self &apos;s struggle for auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity and definition will never end unless it &apos;s connected to its cre@@ ator -- to you and to me .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
and this influ@@ enced me .
so it &apos;s got hy@@ bri@@ d drive .
and so we spent time travel@@ ing with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were pl@@ ent@@ y of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies that weren &apos;t being capit@@ alized on .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations .
the british government -- any government is poten@@ tially the worst cli@@ ent in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
thank you .
one of them , from anthropo@@ log@@ y , is the study of human univer@@ s@@ als .
but if something is written on the s@@ late , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would justi@@ fy dis@@ crimin@@ ation and ine@@ quality .
well , pretty soon they were bar@@ ra@@ ged with en@@ ra@@ ged letters , death thre@@ ats , ban on the top@@ ic in a number of scientific journ@@ als , coming from i@@ rate le@@ ft@@ -@@ h@@ anders and their ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the ven@@ om and vi@@ tu@@ per@@ ation that they had in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently inspired .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is sky@@ rock@@ eting , as you can tell from the price of oper@@ a ti@@ ckets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical ti@@ tles rele@@ ased , the number of new al@@ bu@@ ms and so on .
well , the argument in &quot; the blan@@ k s@@ late &quot; was that eli@@ te art and cri@@ tic@@ ism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have dis@@ da@@ ined beauty , pleasure , c@@ lar@@ ity , insi@@ ght and style .
wrong . iden@@ tical tw@@ ins , or any si@@ bl@@ ings , who are separ@@ ated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together .
so i called the human@@ e society and i say , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some lam@@ bs , can you tell me the deal ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know .
and i said , &quot; yes , like the human@@ e society .
al@@ bert instru@@ cts , &quot; push it way up there . &quot;
it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; is .
i can still see h@@ ill@@ ary doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ ye , dri@@ b@@ bling down her ch@@ in , with the steel workers .
you ask him , &quot; did you follow your passion here ? &quot;
un@@ speak@@ ably dangerous .
you see him all the time .
i got a lot wrong .
i &apos;ve got par@@ ent@@ -@@ child rela@@ tional problems , which i bl@@ ame my parents for .
but he fa@@ ked it too well , and now he &apos;s stuck in broad@@ mo@@ or and nobody will believe he &apos;s san@@ e .
fa@@ ke ma@@ dness .
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
and his clin@@ i@@ cian said to me , &quot; if you want to know more about psychop@@ a@@ ths , you can go on a psychop@@ ath spo@@ tting course run by robert h@@ are who invented the psychop@@ ath che@@ ck@@ list . &quot;
can i come and interview you about your special brain an@@ om@@ al@@ y ? &quot;
and he looked intri@@ gu@@ ed despite himself , and he said , &quot; okay , go on . &quot;
and we stit@@ ch them together like medi@@ ev@@ al mon@@ ks .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
let me say par@@ en@@ the@@ tically why i think that &apos;s the case , because i think it &apos;s a poten@@ tially contro@@ versi@@ al stat@@ ement .
you can show a mo@@ squ@@ e , or you can show wor@@ shi@@ p@@ pers , but there &apos;s not a stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward way of de@@ pic@@ ting islam .
and the hop@@ e@@ ful response der@@ i@@ ves from recogni@@ zing that islam and democracy are technologies .
because they would have done extra@@ ordin@@ arily well .
and it is cru@@ cial -- it is cru@@ cial in a practical , activ@@ ist way -- for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their pre@@ fer@@ ences , their choices and their voices to encoura@@ ge that out@@ come .
now at the time , i was working down the street .
and colle@@ c@@ tively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
but an interesting thing was not@@ ed during the training process .
and they could be extin@@ ct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
corner row ra@@ il@@ way , station car park , front of a health center , people &apos;s front gar@@ dens , and even in front of the police station .
so , back to the public meeting .
so we got some land that was don@@ ated by a local garden center .
whi@@ che@@ ver way they want to do it , of their own vo@@ li@@ tion , they &apos;re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &apos;ve got communities across america and japan -- it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ? i mean , america and japan and new ze@@ al@@ and .
and i &apos;m also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
so if religion is not about belie@@ ving things , what is it about ?
and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather re@@ bar@@ ba@@ tive tex@@ ts is a good d@@ ress re@@ he@@ ar@@ sal for doing the same in ordinary life .
tell us where we &apos;re going wrong . let &apos;s talk together about where religion is fail@@ ing . &quot;
it &apos;s what is meant by over@@ coming the hor@@ ror that we feel when we are under threat of our ene@@ mi@@ es , and beginning to appreci@@ ate the other .
as we go smaller , here is a human hair .
so this little ant that &apos;s cra@@ w@@ ling here , it &apos;s like it &apos;s in a little wil@@ ly won@@ ka land .
i couldn &apos;t believe it , and i &apos;d go around dis@@ se@@ cting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites come in continu@@ ously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with po@@ w@@ der now , because for four billion years it &apos;s been bom@@ bar@@ ded by micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites , and when micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites come in at about 20 to 6@@ 0,000 miles an hour , they va@@ po@@ ri@@ ze on contact .
it was just one of those po@@ t-@@ lu@@ ck things where you get it right first time .
the design comes from within .
technology in x-@@ ray where it &apos;s life@@ -@@ size process@@ ed , apart from these large car@@ go@@ -@@ scan@@ ning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resol@@ ution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
and when they do , i &apos;m in the qu@@ eu@@ e .
and that &apos;s how this was done . it &apos;s actually sli@@ ce , sli@@ ce .
but i could get a bit dar@@ ker in the tube , but everything else would suff@@ er .
and i think that would look quite ne@@ at as an x-@@ ray .
but i also don &apos;t understand how it does ru@@ in the magic .
but every single thing that makes us , every at@@ om in us , has already created a my@@ ri@@ ad of different things and will go on to create a my@@ ri@@ ad of new things .
now i know you don &apos;t think that .
every time i brea@@ the in , i &apos;m brea@@ thing in a milli@@ on-@@ billi@@ on-@@ billion atoms of oxygen .
meet tony . he &apos;s my student .
maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opini@@ ons ; everyone &apos;s got an opini@@ on .
and i say to tony , &quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot;
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circu@@ it . &quot;
and this is happening here .
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , tox@@ ins , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the prepar@@ ation of information , i &apos;ve looked at from the vie@@ w@@ point of food .
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time investi@@ g@@ ating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty sho@@ cking , but more about that later .
a bank in paris held accoun@@ ts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american ban@@ ks , well , they fun@@ nel@@ ed 7@@ 3 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california man@@ sion .
it found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anony@@ mous sh@@ ell companies , tot@@ aling almost 5@@ 6 billion dollars .
now , it just shouldn &apos;t take these sorts of eff@@ or@@ ts to find out where the money in de@@ als like this went .
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word everywhere .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that &apos;s right next to this world .
she &apos;s a high school student .
not running from loss , but enter@@ ing g@@ rief , sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ing to sor@@ row .
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are viol@@ ated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordin@@ ar@@ iness of it , is so de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing to one &apos;s sou@@ l that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
p@@ ure content and p@@ ure form , side by side .
i was so wa@@ sted . &quot;
i set up the type , i prin@@ ted it out on an ep@@ son prin@@ ter with wat@@ er-@@ solu@@ ble ink , ta@@ ped it to the wall and thre@@ w a bu@@ cket of water at it . pre@@ st@@ o !
seriously .
not exactly j@@ ack@@ ie coll@@ ins .
like my wish that no one went hun@@ gry or that everything were a free kind of u@@ top@@ ia .
we love challenges , but when expec@@ tations are low , trust me , we will sin@@ k to them .
and in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that c@@ lon@@ ing is possible , and that invol@@ ves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation .
when i began recor@@ ding in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , the typical metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding were limited to the frag@@ mented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like ma@@ mm@@ als and am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans .
however , our e@@ ars tell us a very different story .
this is probably the sa@@ d@@ dest sound i &apos;ve ever heard coming from any organis@@ m , human or other .
the school teachers weren &apos;t having much fun , the spor@@ ts were very dir@@ ty or very pain@@ ful .
but of course the scientists couldn &apos;t help themselves .
so there &apos;s a lot more female gam@@ ers than people are really aware .
so as far as popul@@ ar@@ ity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
and once we get enough of those guys , we &apos;re going to want more fan@@ t@@ asy artists that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or characters that we &apos;ve just never seen before .
i &apos;m addi@@ cted , because even though i know i &apos;m losing my gri@@ p on reality , i still cra@@ ve more .
no butt@@ ons to push , no tri@@ g@@ gers to pull , just me and the game .
but maybe bra@@ in@@ was@@ hing isn &apos;t always bad .
as far as colle@@ ges go , there &apos;s about 3@@ 50 colle@@ ges around the world teaching video game cour@@ ses .
thank you .
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our fla@@ ws .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theor@@ em , which is a truly sub@@ tle and interesting pro@@ of , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
and the mathemati@@ cians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two pro@@ gressi@@ ons as a fir@@ st-@@ order dis@@ cre@@ te differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation and a secon@@ d-@@ order dis@@ cre@@ te differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation , der@@ i@@ ved by si@@ x-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
so if you look at the little scri@@ pt here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
and they say , &quot; oh , yeah . const@@ ant acceler@@ ation .
the future of life , where the un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit . i don &apos;t have any sli@@ des .
now i know there &apos;s been a whole lot of h@@ yp@@ e about our power to control biology .
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
and it is really not su@@ ited for the future that we &apos;re moving into .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
humanity is going to go down this path .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies , is that it &apos;s easy to become se@@ duced by them .
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
gre@@ g@@ ory stock : to up@@ grade is human
it &apos;s our own pon@@ d . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot;
mom , does the man just say , &apos; is now the time to take off my pants ? &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans ma@@ ting ? &quot;
so the possibility exists to simply ex@@ tern@@ ally wra@@ p the pi@@ pe .
once you &apos;ve made it , the instal@@ lation &apos;s quite easy .
and as you can see , there are not only two princi@@ p@@ al technical discipl@@ ines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various speci@@ alists from within those two discipl@@ ines .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in po@@ land .
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
and as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
that makes a good carto@@ on .
it has ro@@ cked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consu@@ me music .
you know the story .
and i went to see the do@@ z@@ o .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice carto@@ ons .
thank you .
if you go back two billion years , you &apos;re not on an ear@@ th-@@ like planet any more .
we are right now in the beautiful ore@@ o of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horri@@ ble micro@@ bi@@ al age .
and the black rock is the se@@ di@@ ment on the sea bottom in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of plan@@ k@@ ton .
these are mam@@ mal@@ -@@ like re@@ p@@ ti@@ les .
the survi@@ vor@@ s that do get through produce this world of cro@@ co@@ di@@ le-@@ like creatures .
it can only occu@@ r if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally satur@@ ated with hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de -- enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
it &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years .
now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de in this soli@@ d graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
am i understanding you right , that what you &apos;re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio@@ chemical response to hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de that in your mind pro@@ ves that there have been past mass extin@@ ctions due to climate change ?
it &apos;s forced child labor and all of those products probably end their lives in a du@@ mp like this one in man@@ il@@ a .
and their factory in china -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingre@@ di@@ ents from back@@ y@@ ard ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs , where families s@@ lau@@ ghter pig@@ s and extra@@ ct the ingre@@ dient .
their vot@@ ers are local .
even if they did their jobs , and they c@@ ited those facili@@ ties for their viol@@ ations , the fine would be der@@ is@@ ory .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accoun@@ t@@ ability often doesn &apos;t work .
there are thousands of supp@@ li@@ ers in there . &quot;
join us , come into that safe space , and let &apos;s start to make this happen .
you will put the star in starting over , and over .
so i write po@@ em@@ s to figure things out .
now i can divi@@ de my spo@@ ken word journey into three steps .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of y@@ ours .
it &apos;s not that i think that spo@@ ken word poetry is the ide@@ al art form .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bo@@ wer@@ y poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
i was a student in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , a time of social up@@ hea@@ val and questi@@ oning , and on a personal level , an a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ing sense of ide@@ alism .
but i was driven by an in@@ her@@ ent sense that a picture that reve@@ aled the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-@@ war photograph .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my an@@ ger .
this man had just been liber@@ ated from a hu@@ tu death camp .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a ra@@ il@@ way em@@ bank@@ ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
an m@@ s@@ f hospital in a camp for dis@@ placed people .
this is a heli@@ cop@@ ter medi@@ c giving c@@ p@@ r to a soldi@@ er who had been shot in the head .
whenever there is an ele@@ ction , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to che@@ at , or something goes acci@@ dent@@ ally aw@@ ry -- a bal@@ lot box goes missing here , cha@@ ds are left han@@ ging over here .
and there &apos;s some complicated cr@@ yp@@ to@@ graph@@ y going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is vot@@ ing with one of these forms .
david bis@@ mark demo@@ s a new system for vot@@ ing that con@@ tains a simple , ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able way to prevent fr@@ au@@ d and mis@@ coun@@ ting -- while keeping each person &apos;s vote secret .
but that sub@@ divi@@ des chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam and budd@@ h@@ ism into many sub@@ groups , which was too deta@@ iled .
but there was also many chri@@ stian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
but there are also countries here like gu@@ atem@@ ala , like pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a , like ye@@ men and afghanistan .
here we have q@@ at@@ ar today , and there we have banglades@@ h today .
and the world population will stop growing .
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
i wo@@ und up on every television show .
we dec@@ lar@@ ed small@@ po@@ x er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated in 19@@ 80 .
but in that year , small@@ po@@ x explo@@ ded throughout india .
we failed three other times .
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in tam@@ il na@@ du , india .
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .
but in all seri@@ ousness -- because this idea is birth@@ ed in ted , i would like it to be a leg@@ acy of ted , and i &apos;d like to call it the &quot; international system for total early disease dete@@ ction . &quot;
but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and un@@ expla@@ ined clu@@ ster of ill@@ n@@ esses that looked like bird flu .
the first number is three : three billion people .
we know from asking people from china to the u.@@ s .
you &apos;ll change your smar@@ t@@ phone seven or eight times , probably more if you &apos;re in this audience .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
the electricity is free .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
there was this equ@@ ation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spi@@ ritual .
i &apos;ve always been attra@@ cted to those rare people who pull that off , who de@@ vote their lives to humanity with the gr@@ it of the war@@ ri@@ or and the gra@@ ce of the my@@ stic -- people like martin lu@@ ther king , j@@ r . , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
or maybe your bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
we agre@@ ed we &apos;d speak up in our own communities when we wit@@ n@@ essed the kind of &quot; other@@ i@@ zing &quot; talk that can wo@@ und and fe@@ ster into par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and then be used by those on the fr@@ ing@@ es to inci@@ te .
i travel@@ ed to iraq , afghanistan and liber@@ ia .
and he &apos;s on a mission .
and that they were definitely capable of diff@@ using it non-@@ ag@@ gressi@@ vely .
but the question that l@@ ing@@ ered in my mind was , what causes people to destro@@ y fire tru@@ cks head@@ ed to their own homes ?
it &apos;s been repor@@ ted that wiki@@ lea@@ ks , your baby , has , in the last few years has rele@@ ased more classi@@ fied docum@@ ents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combin@@ ed .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political le@@ verage on mo@@ i , who was the rich@@ est man -- still is the rich@@ est man -- in kenya .
ro@@ ger . i got &apos; em .
j well , because these sort of things reve@@ al what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human@@ -@@ rights ab@@ uses in those governments .
it will change the perception and opini@@ on of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult docum@@ ent for us .
can that be right ?
that made you very high-@@ profi@@ le in ic@@ eland . what happened next ?
the musi@@ cians played off a three-@@ dimensional graph of weather data like this .
the ver@@ tical elements are as@@ sig@@ ned a specific hour of the day .
lau@@ ren ho@@ dge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a heal@@ thi@@ er option , which would you choose , gri@@ ll@@ ed or fri@@ ed chicken ?
so it was a big commit@@ ment to drive to the lab to work multiple times .
sounds ridi@@ cul@@ ous , right .
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with che@@ mo@@ therapy today .
1.@@ 6 million dea@@ ths worldwide .
so j@@ ul@@ ie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her as@@ th@@ ma .
so i want you to rei@@ mag@@ ine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
and interest@@ ingly , from an identity stand@@ point , what does it mean to have a dis@@ ability ?
so wh@@ im@@ sy matters .
thank you .
so after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this japanese man@@ ager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; so , miss y@@ ang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot;
so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
first of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the one-@@ child policy .
so for the past few years , the co@@ ast@@ al areas , they found themselves in a shor@@ tage of labor .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participa@@ tion in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
and our yo@@ unger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being trans@@ formed themselves .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fa@@ te of these bear families , and indeed that of all be@@ ars around the north pacific , depen@@ ds on the sal@@ mon .
ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty is the mother of evolution .
but just looking up with the na@@ ked eye , you really don &apos;t need one .
a culture which is top@@ -@@ down , ow@@ ned , where the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds of the millions have been lost .
now , as@@ ca@@ p said they didn &apos;t care .
i want to share all my love with you ...
the extre@@ mis@@ m on one side be@@ gets extre@@ mis@@ m on the other , a fact we should have learned many , many times over , and both extre@@ mes in this debate are just wrong .
we can only make them , quote , &quot; pir@@ ates . &quot; and is that good ?
because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very ti@@ red . &quot;
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &apos;s because you agre@@ ed to get lied to .
if you don &apos;t want to be dec@@ ei@@ ved , you have to know , what is it that you &apos;re hun@@ gry for ?
lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
the rest of us , we &apos;re only 5@@ 4 percent accu@@ rate .
we all ch@@ at@@ ter with our finger@@ ti@@ ps .
they &apos;re going to be in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated if they sense they &apos;re wr@@ on@@ g@@ ly acc@@ used throughout the entire course of the interview , not just in flas@@ hes ; they &apos;ll be in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated throughout the entire course of the interview .
your new jo@@ int vent@@ ure partner might sha@@ ke your hand , celebra@@ te , go out to dinner with you and then lea@@ k an expression of an@@ ger .
don &apos;t be too ag@@ gressi@@ ve , it doesn &apos;t work .
but you &apos;ve got to ask yourself in the mean@@ time : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who &apos;s trained in getting to the truth or some guy who &apos;s going to dra@@ g a 40@@ 0-@@ po@@ und electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m through the door ?
it &apos;s down@@ h@@ ill from now on . i wanted to thank e@@ me@@ ka and chris .
that &apos;s very important .
nigeria got its indepen@@ dence in 1960 .
so i had a very inven@@ tive teacher , a paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m , who wanted to teach us about this .
and fr@@ as@@ er &apos;s on his k@@ ne@@ es , arms ti@@ ed behind his back , and he &apos;s cr@@ ying .
and i watched them being lo@@ cked up in prison and te@@ ar gas@@ sed .
my friend r@@ on@@ ald got@@ tes@@ man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite regul@@ arly .
they ta@@ p into local entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al talent , and they do incredible marketing .
and they decided in 199@@ 0 that they wanted to start training the local entreprene@@ urs , giving them small lo@@ ans .
now the reason these micro@@ -@@ entreprene@@ urs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pus@@ h@@ c@@ art or their wheel@@ bar@@ row .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
we know that circum@@ c@@ ision redu@@ ces hiv infe@@ ction by 60 percent in men .
well on september 4@@ th , there was a huge m@@ op@@ -up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
but still , now we have global warming .
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
so the fis@@ her@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
so how much of this do we have ?
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reser@@ ves , is that the fund@@ ing models have been wrong .
so , basically , the production sur@@ plus of these guys down there is enough to main@@ tain this bio@@ mass that is not moving .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
we use the sub@@ marine al@@ v@@ in and we use c@@ ameras , and the c@@ ameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of son@@ y .
they &apos;re very little understood .
and there &apos;s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven &apos;t been ma@@ pped yet .
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from inside the earth .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
they don &apos;t need the sun at all .
b@@ l : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simpl@@ est form of life found .
el nin@@ o comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s rhyth@@ mic .
this is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
i believe in real life .
and then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , specifically what that means .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-@@ quality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our front po@@ cket .
the lesson of brian &apos;s pres@@ entation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that van@@ tage point determin@@ es everything that you see .
it was bor@@ ing .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the k@@ ings and que@@ ens of kenya or britain .
what do they look like ?
waiting 10 years for the pa@@ yo@@ ff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &apos;ve got si@@ bl@@ ings to look after or a business to help with .
that &apos;s one city .
and there will be no mistakes . &quot;
you &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
but it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapi@@ dly and or@@ der@@ ly , actually the school system is recogni@@ z@@ ably an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance from the 19@@ th century , from a bis@@ marki@@ an model of ger@@ man scho@@ ol@@ ing that got taken up by english re@@ form@@ ers , and often by religious mis@@ sion@@ aries , taken up in the united states as a force of social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on , and then in japan and south korea as they developed .
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to te@@ ars , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
and because i have a 15@@ -year-old , all i do is co@@ ok and co@@ ok and co@@ ok .
it &apos;s really sc@@ ary , this gay lifest@@ yle thing ; it &apos;s super du@@ per evil and there &apos;s no end to it !
the u.s. const@@ it@@ ution is the gay agenda .
but when you see the map , and you see our state of mich@@ ig@@ an -- it &apos;s legal to fire someone for being gay , les@@ bi@@ an , bis@@ ex@@ ual or trans@@ gen@@ dered , that it &apos;s legal to re@@ move someone from their home because they &apos;re gay , les@@ bi@@ an , bis@@ ex@@ ual or trans@@ gen@@ dered , then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equ@@ ality is not about stri@@ pping someone &apos;s rights away , it &apos;s about gran@@ ting them the rights that &#91; have &#93; already been st@@ ated .
thank you .
some of the studies even say we &apos;re happ@@ ier .
entrop@@ y means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of dec@@ line and deca@@ y , the ar@@ ch .
how was i supposed to live it ?
if however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re-@@ vision our relationship to past people and events , neu@@ ral path@@ ways can change .
i know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking at these pictures .
they have to try and attra@@ ct pol@@ lin@@ ators to do their bi@@ d@@ ding .
it &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
this is the phil@@ o@@ den@@ dr@@ on s@@ ell@@ ou@@ m .
last week i took these pictures of rock ro@@ se , heli@@ an@@ them@@ um , in dor@@ set .
maybe you &apos;re ti@@ cked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . you &apos;ve been up too late playing a game .
and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he &apos;s got zig &apos;s indian reser@@ vation . and this particular shot , this is one of the more traditional sh@@ ots . this is a rain dan@@ cer .
and she says , &quot; they want to go . &quot; and i said , &quot; hon@@ ey , no they don &apos;t want to go . this is the middle pas@@ sage .
this is a game with 5@@ 0,000 individual pieces .
what you &apos;re looking at is airplane traffic over north america for a 24@@ -@@ hour period .
you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
so they made this web service and said , &quot; any program@@ mer can write a piece of software and ta@@ p into the minds of thousands of people . &quot;
that gives you an idea of the different types of mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions and de@@ dic@@ ation .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divi@@ ded it into 10,000 teen@@ y pieces , and we f@@ ed those into the mechan@@ ical tur@@ k .
you &apos;d be f@@ ed a simple audi@@ o clip .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of r@@ ally behind and build something for .
ak : so if you go to the website john@@ n@@ y@@ cas@@ h@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com , what you &apos;ll see is the video playing above .
win bu@@ t@@ ler : now our lives are changing fast now our lives are changing fast hope that something p@@ ure can last hope that something p@@ ure can last o@@ oh we used to wait o@@ oh we used to wait o@@ oh we used to wait sometimes it never came sometimes it never came still moving through the pain we used to wait for it we used to wait for it we used to wait for it ak : so i think , if there &apos;s one thing to take away from my talk today , it &apos;s that an interface can be a powerful narra@@ tive device .
and it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things .
so if you don &apos;t know one of these languages , it &apos;s inst@@ ant learning .
here it &apos;s &quot; c@@ and@@ y@@ city . &quot;
and par@@ alle@@ l to my cutting is my running .
it &apos;s not auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal identi@@ ties .
so for the sub@@ way in new york , i saw a cor@@ respon@@ dence between ri@@ ding the sub@@ way and reading .
so it acts as a screen to protect the ra@@ il and the com@@ mu@@ ter , and not to have objects fall@@ ing on the ra@@ ils .
b@@ é@@ at@@ ri@@ ce cor@@ on : stories cut from paper
now , the opposite of a s@@ no@@ b is your mother .
en@@ vy , it &apos;s a real tab@@ o@@ o to mention en@@ vy , but if there is one domin@@ ant emotion in modern society , that is en@@ vy .
there is another reason why we might be feeling more an@@ xi@@ ous , about our care@@ ers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
but i think it &apos;s in@@ san@@ e to believe that we will ever make a society that is genu@@ in@@ ely mer@@ it@@ o@@ cra@@ tic . it &apos;s an impossible dream .
now is there any alternative to this ?
and so we tend to wor@@ ship ourselves .
psycho@@ analysis has been dru@@ mming home this message for about 80 years .
because otherwise it can get quite c@@ lau@@ st@@ rop@@ ho@@ bi@@ c .
and i decided the reme@@ dy to all this mal@@ a@@ ise was going to be for me to ch@@ ase an el@@ ev@@ ated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require u@@ tter con@@ vi@@ ction and un@@ wa@@ vering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspe@@ ct of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of con@@ vi@@ ction .
the navi@@ gation is difficult .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central nervous system .
and i swa@@ m through the night and i swa@@ m through the next day .
and a little kid from the back was like this .
yeah .
thank you . thank you .
and what about sleep ?
this is a device that not only meas@@ ures car@@ di@@ a@@ c rhyth@@ m , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .
that looks like this .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
there are two things that can really acceler@@ ate this whole process .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clin@@ ic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equ@@ ally impres@@ sive across all these different diseases and more .
how do we make stable societies ? lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
and you get to think about yourself and your memor@@ ies , and before you go back into sus@@ pen@@ sion , you ed@@ it your memor@@ ies and you change your person@@ ality and so forth .
and , of course , we &apos;re not responsible for the consequences of what we &apos;re doing now , are we ? like all this com@@ pla@@ int about c@@ lon@@ es .
thank you .
so we tried , and i &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
so you can la@@ vis@@ h all the same care , all the same techni@@ que , on a ham@@ bur@@ ger as you would on some much more fan@@ cy dis@@ h .
so it &apos;s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , suppor@@ ted by wir@@ es , and then they take the wir@@ es away digit@@ ally so you &apos;re flying through the air .
that hor@@ n-@@ sha@@ ped region is what we call the swe@@ et spot .
and because people watch my@@ th@@ bu@@ sters and c@@ s@@ i , i thought , well , let &apos;s put in a reci@@ pe for a bal@@ li@@ stics gel@@ a@@ tin .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . &quot;
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instru@@ ments through small in@@ c@@ isi@@ ons .
and now , in contr@@ ast to the la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y , you can pre@@ cis@@ ely place the need@@ le in your instru@@ ments , and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
and you need to re-@@ set it up .
we get to write the scri@@ pt of the next revolution in surgery .
we can he@@ al the disease .
we realized that when plasti@@ cs get to the du@@ mp , it &apos;s difficult to sort them because they have similar den@@ si@@ ties , and when they &apos;re mix@@ ed with organic matter and construction de@@ br@@ is , it &apos;s truly impossible to pick them out and environ@@ ment@@ ally elimin@@ ate them .
not only do ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates po@@ ll@@ ute our environment , but they also po@@ ll@@ ute our bodies .
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates .
thank you . j@@ y : thank you .
but people live on this land .
this is an unusual instal@@ lation of air@@ port se@@ ating .
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the colle@@ c@@ tors like .
here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
so we &apos;re going to watch another film .
so , &quot; i saw many tra@@ ins and also ro@@ de on one .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the ben@@ ch .
it &apos;s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful common@@ ality between design , business and the world .
that &apos;s what we all need to do .
it was min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing .
but if corruption cre@@ e@@ ps in and people don &apos;t have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with im@@ pun@@ ity , you can reach out and harv@@ est the vulnerable into sla@@ very .
so , that &apos;s a scen@@ ari@@ o that we think we should be capit@@ ali@@ zing on .
these young boys are in ne@@ p@@ al .
liber@@ ation , however , costs some money .
children res@@ cu@@ ed from sla@@ very in the fishing industry in ghana , re@@ united with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villa@@ ges to re@@ build their economic well-@@ being so that they become sla@@ ve-@@ pro@@ of -- absolutely un@@ en@@ sla@@ ve@@ able .
however , only recently , due to several technologi@@ cal advan@@ c@@ ements , we are now able to demon@@ strate to you quant@@ um le@@ vi@@ tation and quant@@ um lo@@ cking .
well , first there are str@@ ands of magnetic field left inside , but now the super@@ conduc@@ tor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their mov@@ ements dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te energy , which brea@@ ks the super@@ conduc@@ tivity state .
now , i can ex@@ tend this cir@@ cular mag@@ net , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from dou@@ glas ad@@ ams , and the situation is from &quot; the hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s gui@@ de to the galaxy . &quot;
but anyway , i got my su@@ it@@ case of ir@@ on ore and dra@@ g@@ ged it back to london on the train , and then was fac@@ ed with the problem : okay , how do you make this rock into components for a to@@ aster ?
and the last material i &apos;m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my to@@ aster had to have a plastic case .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
so we up@@ d@@ ated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure this , the number of bits being moved around , the size of the internet .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology .
this was in an area called well@@ a@@ wat@@ ta , a prime res@@ identi@@ al area in col@@ om@@ bo .
for hours after@@ wards , the sea was stre@@ wn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the sl@@ um .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
and it &apos;s one that off@@ ers really interesting possibilities for organi@@ zing a whole ho@@ st of activi@@ ties down the road .
it is very easy to fall in love with the de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized , bot@@ tom@@ -up structure of the internet .
and there &apos;s this famous example of one that was 1,@@ 200 feet long and la@@ sted for two days , and the ants just kept mar@@ ching around and around in a circle until they died .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demon@@ strated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
it all began when two scientists , fre@@ d gras@@ s@@ le and j@@ esse au@@ su@@ bel , met in wo@@ ods hole , mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts where both were gu@@ ests at the fam@@ ed oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ phic institute .
and with sal@@ ting , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long di@@ stances .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sam@@ ple the oceans is ac@@ ou@@ stics , or sound waves .
well what they found was mis@@ lab@@ el@@ ed fish .
this is something we &apos;ve actually known for a while , so it &apos;s not a real break@@ through .
but the really interesting thing about it is that , a few years ago , cen@@ su@@ s scientists discovered that this guy can thri@@ ve in oxy@@ gen@@ -@@ poor se@@ di@@ ments in the deep medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an sea .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of un@@ know@@ ns .
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s of relev@@ ance to humans that we really need to , even from a sel@@ fish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a mo@@ dic@@ um of intelligence to that .
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 4@@ 1 -- when she was five , was over@@ heard by me to say to a friend of her@@ s , if it doesn &apos;t ble@@ ed when you cut it , my da@@ d@@ dy doesn &apos;t understand it .
the in@@ do@@ -@@ european ro@@ ot of the word hope is a stem , k-@@ e-@@ u -- we would sp@@ ell it k-@@ e-@@ u ; it &apos;s pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced ko@@ y -- and it is the same ro@@ ot from which the word cur@@ ve comes from .
and i think that it &apos;s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &apos;ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speak@@ ers in the last few days .
we are , should be , mor@@ ally commit@@ ted to being the heal@@ er of the world .
now that &apos;s not quite true . there &apos;s one other way , and that &apos;s through swe@@ ating .
now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ?
you send a comm@@ and down , it causes mus@@ cles to contra@@ ct .
so what are belie@@ fs ?
and what ba@@ yes &apos; rule says is that i should multi@@ p@@ ly the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the elli@@ p@@ ses , and that &apos;s my belief .
now there &apos;s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to dist@@ ingu@@ ish ex@@ ternal events from intern@@ al events .
as you go from 0@@ .@@ 1 to 0@@ .@@ 2 , it becomes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh at the end .
we started with a motor with a little le@@ ver , a little force trans@@ f@@ user .
so i have a huge amount of choice to make .
if i choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then i &apos;ll have a different comm@@ and , different noise , playing through a no@@ is@@ y system , very complicated .
you have to study vision with the reali@@ zation of how the movement system is going to use vision .
and yes , the red planet is red .
here are some recent images .
and what we &apos;re looking at is the pres@@ ence of the gas me@@ than@@ e , ch@@ 4 , in the atmosphere of mars .
in the southern he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere there are impact cr@@ at@@ ers , there are vol@@ can@@ ic cr@@ at@@ ers .
we will fly where the me@@ than@@ e is .
we believe that in a one-@@ hour flight we can re@@ write the text@@ book on mars by making high-@@ resol@@ ution measu@@ re@@ ments of the atmosphere , looking for g@@ ases of bio@@ gen@@ ic orig@@ in , looking for g@@ ases of vol@@ can@@ ic orig@@ in , studying the surface , studying the magne@@ tis@@ m on the surface , which we don &apos;t understand , as well as about a do@@ zen other areas .
if you &apos;re interested in more information , we have a website that descri@@ bes this exciting and intri@@ gu@@ ing mission , and why we want to do it .
i was like , &quot; yeah .
then you notice that if that le@@ go@@ -@@ provi@@ ded c@@ ad program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open-@@ source , thir@@ d-@@ party , independent le@@ go c@@ ad program that lets you do 3d mod@@ el@@ ing and 3d ren@@ der@@ ing and make , in fact , movies out of le@@ go , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mi@@ mi@@ cking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people re@@ creating all sorts of things .
i &apos;m really sc@@ ared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
so , look what they did .
but the pa@@ y-@@ off is really enormous .
california em@@ its only seven percent of u.s. co2 emissions .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely pre@@ vent@@ able disease . that &apos;s malaria . 6@@ ,000 people a day .
do you know , they only invest@@ ed 0@@ .@@ 2 percent of re@@ ven@@ u@@ es in r &amp; amp ; d ?
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21@@ st century .
every do@@ t is a person .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
so , if we want to track something that was spre@@ ading through a network , what we ide@@ ally would like to do is to set up sensor@@ s on the central individuals within the network , including no@@ de a , monit@@ or those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early dete@@ ction of whatever it is that is spre@@ ading through the network .
so , we thought we would explo@@ it this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomen@@ a within networks .
and the size of the dots is going to be propor@@ tional to how many of their friends have the flu .
and the answer is no .
and there are three ways , i think , that these massi@@ ve-@@ passi@@ ve data can be used .
over the past seven years , i &apos;ve been following my fascin@@ ation with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this obs@@ ession has led me to live out of a su@@ it@@ case 3@@ 65 days a year .
and you even find a church .
today , they live in this area , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 5@@ 0,000 to 7@@ 0,000 people , who live in this community of self-@@ built multi-@@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
in a region famous for the soft , por@@ ous lo@@ ess plat@@ e@@ au soil , there lived until recently an esti@@ ma@@ ted 40 million people in these houses under@@ ground .
so you know how it ended up , spen@@ cer tra@@ cy brought a computer , a ma@@ infra@@ me computer of 195@@ 7 , in to help the libr@@ ari@@ ans .
on the right are some tu@@ gs from a company called a@@ eth@@ on in pit@@ ts@@ burgh .
so a person that &apos;s inter@@ acting with the robot under@@ stands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its mo@@ tions .
mil@@ dre@@ d &apos;s a factory wor@@ ker in connec@@ tic@@ ut .
and turned up the other way , the people who are reti@@ re@@ ment age goes up very , very fast , as the baby bo@@ om@@ ers get to reti@@ re@@ ment age .
the system meas@@ ures the be@@ am &apos;s time of flight , recor@@ ding the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
and here , this is a fl@@ y-@@ through the cloud of points of ti@@ k@@ al , and here you see it ren@@ dered and phot@@ o-@@ tex@@ tured with the photograph@@ y that we take of the site .
last mar@@ ch , we received very sad news .
ben k@@ ac@@ y@@ ra : ancient wonder@@ s cap@@ tured in 3d
we had h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st education in the schools .
it will re@@ fer you directly to your con@@ gr@@ es@@ sper@@ son , to your u.s. sen@@ ator , to your gover@@ nor where di@@ v@@ est@@ ment leg@@ is@@ lation is pen@@ ding .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos;t ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged responsibility , and there &apos;s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
he was bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ d@@ y-@@ like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a re@@ alist mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ading as an ide@@ alist or an ide@@ alist mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ading as a re@@ alist , as people always wonder@@ ed about bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ dy and john ken@@ ne@@ dy in that way .
but , u@@ h-@@ oh , the kill@@ ers are within the cam@@ ps .
you &apos;re un@@ -@@ ow@@ ned .
don &apos;t black@@ -@@ box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door .
fourth and final point : he somehow , because he was working in all the world &apos;s worst places and all less@@ er ev@@ ils , had a hu@@ mili@@ ty , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
a hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hard@@ ship due to this .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutri@@ tion , mal@@ nutri@@ tion out on the front lines .
well two years ago , we decided , let &apos;s transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food ban@@ ks .
it is a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ win situation that starts the food economy moving .
well , the world bank esti@@ mates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10@@ .@@ 3 -- to address mal@@ nutri@@ tion in those countries .
so , this is an a@@ sto@@ unding table .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it -- although we can &apos;t make v@@ acc@@ ine in this country , but that &apos;s a different story .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an out@@ put and a state in the middle .
if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called tax@@ ol every three weeks , which is the standard , about 40 percent of women with meta@@ sta@@ tic cancer have a great response to that drug .
so , instead of a re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist view , we &apos;re taking a step back .
the problem is that , if i &apos;m this do@@ c , and i get your ct scan today and you &apos;ve got a two centi@@ meter mass in your li@@ ver , and you come back to me in three months and it &apos;s three centi@@ meters , did that drug help you or not ?
and so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having paper in my ch@@ art , in your ch@@ art , and it being this thi@@ ck , this is what data flow is starting to look like in our off@@ ices , where that drop of blood is creating gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data .
most people find that very so@@ o@@ thing , and , interest@@ ingly , 12 cy@@ cles per minute is roughly the frequ@@ ency of the brea@@ thing of a sle@@ eping human .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel un@@ comfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
you all recognize that one . this is the mo@@ st-@@ played tun@@ e in the world today .
and i stood there bes@@ i@@ de two very good friends of mine , richard we@@ ber and kev@@ in v@@ all@@ ely .
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 3@@ 3 days , we would be blog@@ ging , telling stories of , you know , de@@ ple@@ ted o@@ zone for@@ cing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
that i &apos;m this u@@ ber@@ -@@ en@@ dur@@ ance guy ?
i actually love di@@ ving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the da@@ y@@ time .
no matter where on earth you live .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ales .
we kill using long lines , with ba@@ ited ho@@ o@@ ks every few feet that may stre@@ tch for 50 miles or more .
and , in 197@@ 2 , this nation began to establi@@ sh a counter@@ part in the sea , national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries .
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
without insects , there &apos;d be no flo@@ wer@@ ing plants .
they have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
a mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly .
and these are the two concep@@ ts i &apos;d like to explore .
so this is the prepar@@ ation that one of my former post-@@ do@@ cs , gab@@ y ma@@ im@@ on , who &apos;s now at rock@@ ef@@ eller , developed , and it &apos;s basically a flight simul@@ ator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electro@@ de in the brain of the fly and record from a gene@@ tically identi@@ fied neuron in the fly &apos;s brain .
the first is , it &apos;s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
so i can say , with some certain@@ ty , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot;
we &apos;re just pac@@ king in colum@@ ns , so that we &apos;d have more ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical colum@@ ns to per@@ form more complex fun@@ ctions .
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circu@@ it@@ ry does change .
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; my god . how is reality coming out of that ? &quot;
this took place in my childhood -- 195@@ 7 to &apos; 65 .
&quot; spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p project offi@@ cially be@@ gun . job waiting for you . dy@@ son . &quot;
so , these are three-@@ po@@ und char@@ ges of c@@ 4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
this is a 20 man version for going to ju@@ pit@@ er : bun@@ ks , stor@@ m cell@@ ars , exercise room .
you know , i don &apos;t know how many of those you read , but it &apos;s not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write .
which i think is just fascinating .
very very hard .
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how lin@@ ked you are .
interest@@ ingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join .
this is from a paper by re@@ del@@ mei@@ er and scha@@ ef@@ er .
there is one more decision .
a print sub@@ scri@@ ption for 1@@ 25 .
and because we don &apos;t know our pre@@ fer@@ ences that well we &apos;re sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to all of these influ@@ ences from the ex@@ ternal forces : the de@@ fau@@ l@@ ts , the particular op@@ tions that are pres@@ ented to us , and so on .
the sil@@ ver lin@@ ing is , i think , kind of the reason that behavi@@ oral economics is interesting and exciting .
they are sc@@ ar@@ ce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
and then we have the radio waves , they have the issues i &apos;ve just mentioned .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we explo@@ it with our technology .
you think , &quot; ha , ha , ha .
and then i &apos;ve mentioned the avail@@ ability .
and then you have these millions of street lam@@ ps de@@ plo@@ yed around the world .
you &apos;ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we &apos;ve been able to create with just a one and a zero .
and then james wat@@ son &apos;s -- one of the co-@@ fo@@ under@@ s of dna -- genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
an architect far better and smar@@ ter than us has given us that to@@ ol@@ box , and we now have the ability to use it .
we could produce better fla@@ vor@@ s and ar@@ om@@ as .
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question : &quot; well , somebody has to . &quot;
i &apos;m s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing this other dog &apos;s re@@ ar end , the ow@@ ner &apos;s calling . &quot;
and what you will find is a very , very low-@@ ran@@ king bit@@ ch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-@@ ran@@ king male .
and that &apos;s how we use the food l@@ ure in the hand , and we use food because we &apos;re dealing with ow@@ ners .
so we go , &quot; sit , &quot; on the cou@@ ch ; &quot; sit , &quot; tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ ru@@ b ; &quot; sit , &quot; look , i throw a ten@@ nis ball ; &quot; sit , &quot; say hell@@ o to that other dog .
they think a pun@@ ish@@ ment is something na@@ sty .
your head now is 100 y@@ ards away , sa@@ il@@ ing through the air , ok ?
and ug@@ ly face is this -- when you go fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with a pu@@ pp@@ y or a child , you say , &quot; what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! &quot;
it really is .
speaking at the 2007 e@@ g conference , train@@ er ian dun@@ bar as@@ ks us to see the world through the eyes of our belo@@ ved dogs . by knowing our pe@@ ts &apos; perspective , we can build their love and trust . it &apos;s a message that res@@ on@@ ates well beyond the animal world .
and you made it out of what ?
w@@ k : yeah , i want to build another one -- to pu@@ mp water and ir@@ ri@@ gation for cro@@ ps .
and so this is basically a song about lo@@ ops , but not the kind of lo@@ ops that i make up here .
and that &apos;s what the song is asking .
every time i read che@@ k@@ ho@@ v and his unique vision of human life , i &apos;m remin@@ ded of why i too became a writer .
what about bigger numbers ?
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
the h@@ are itself , the animal -- not a c@@ at , not a dog , a h@@ are -- why a h@@ are ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more pro@@ sper@@ ous as it becomes more popul@@ ous ?
and it &apos;s this combin@@ ation , this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive technology , that intri@@ gues me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
there &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
and that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of pro@@ sper@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qui@@ re another good or service .
we &apos;re able to draw upon speci@@ alization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
and so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual di@@ vision of labor .
and that will have led to speci@@ alization .
the person on the assem@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in un@@ consci@@ ously , on a collective level .
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet .
and this is what the next piece is about .
as we try to build this view , and try to educ@@ ate ourselves about the enor@@ m@@ ity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gigan@@ tic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trilli@@ ons .
you &apos;re looking at the outside sh@@ ell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evol@@ ving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evol@@ ving very fast .
but really , it &apos;s pretty rob@@ ust .
and there &apos;re only 10@@ 2 because people got bor@@ ed colle@@ cting them : there are just new ones every year .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
we put the bee@@ per in the clin@@ ic .
i mean , they went to the ma@@ x for this woman .
and what i &apos;m telling you here from the signal , is that men who have a mu@@ tation in this an@@ tivi@@ ral defen@@ se enzy@@ me , and have a tumor , often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a sig@@ nature which reve@@ als a new retro@@ virus .
joe der@@ is@@ i : solving medical myster@@ ies
here &apos;s the first battery -- a st@@ ack of co@@ ins , zin@@ c and sil@@ ver , separ@@ ated by car@@ d@@ board so@@ ak@@ ed in br@@ ine .
the electro@@ ly@@ te is not a solution of s@@ alt and water , but rather s@@ alt that &apos;s mel@@ ted .
it &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory .
so a year and a half ago , david and i , along with another research sta@@ ff@@ -@@ member , formed a company to acceler@@ ate the rate of progress and the race to manufac@@ ture product .
don@@ ald sa@@ do@@ way : the missing link to rene@@ w@@ able energy
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
did you find the gold ?
things where you might trip across things like the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can principle , the fer@@ m@@ i parado@@ x , the anthro@@ pi@@ c principle , the orig@@ in of life .
so pretty much players are encoura@@ ged to be very creative in the game .
so this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
now here , our entire oceans are ev@@ a@@ por@@ ating off the surface , and as it kee@@ ps getting hot@@ ter at some point the entire planet &apos;s going to melt down .
and so you &apos;d have this wonderful spar@@ kl@@ ing thing , with the dis@@ k slowly ro@@ tat@@ ing , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imag@@ in@@ ative way , so that they can start c@@ ali@@ br@@ ating their instin@@ ct across these vast sc@@ ales of space and time .
even the b@@ b@@ c and the new york times .
so they do this both when they have power sort of chron@@ ically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
so business schools have been strug@@ gling with this gender grade gap .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and as@@ ser@@ tive and domin@@ ant , but not very stress re@@ active , the person who &apos;s la@@ id back .
so two minutes lead to these hor@@ mon@@ al changes that con@@ figure your brain to basically be either as@@ ser@@ tive , confi@@ dent and comfortable , or really st@@ res@@ s-@@ re@@ active , and , you know , feeling sort of shu@@ t down . and we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
we also ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively over@@ all . &quot;
and the night before my fir@@ st-@@ year talk , and the fir@@ st-@@ year talk at prin@@ c@@ et@@ on is a 20@@ -@@ minute talk to 20 people . that &apos;s it .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
so you &apos;re out in the wo@@ ods , or you &apos;re out in the pa@@ st@@ ure , and you see this ant cra@@ w@@ ling up this bla@@ de of gr@@ ass .
many people have la@@ id down their lives for commun@@ ism , and many have la@@ id down their lives for capit@@ alism .
now , what theor@@ ies do we want to use to look at this ?
not silicon .
there are other par@@ as@@ ites that do this -- which ren@@ der the ho@@ st ster@@ i@@ le .
they &apos;re not a big deal for us .
now in the old days , conduc@@ ting , music making , was less about trust and more , frank@@ ly , about co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
i have to say , in those days , i couldn &apos;t really even find the bird .
they don &apos;t read music .
do you hear it ?
well done , ladies and gentle@@ men .
ly@@ n : when i &apos;m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cock@@ p@@ it flying an airplane .
my un@@ cle ed gave me a beautiful blue swe@@ ater -- at least i thought it was beautiful .
we focused on a business model ; we insi@@ sted on skin in the game .
they are farmers and factory workers .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that africa lo@@ ses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down pay@@ ment on her house .
well three sons got into a negoti@@ ation .
how do we deal with our deep@@ est differences , given the human pro@@ pen@@ sity for conflict and the human geni@@ us at de@@ vis@@ ing weapons of enormous destruction ?
and we can play an incredibly con@@ struc@@ tive role .
now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s wid@@ ely re@@ gar@@ ded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
now as anthropo@@ logi@@ sts , we know that every culture has an orig@@ in story .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
let me ask you a question .
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
but they did it thanks to a common identity -- europe -- and a common economy .
nat@@ al@@ ie ma@@ c@@ master : cape bre@@ ton fi@@ dd@@ ling in re@@ el time
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we a@@ im@@ ing at .
you and your kids are fine .
that &apos;s our average budget .
they do all aspe@@ cts of the work .
they could tra@@ p the flies , send them to him in per@@ th .
i put it to you , is this elimin@@ ating poverty ?
so when i do my job , people hate me .
and second , i don &apos;t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
but it all starts with see@@ ds in class@@ rooms , in my place , which looks like this .
and what &apos;d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the ham@@ p@@ tons .
that &apos;s a picture i took of my bronx bor@@ ough president , add@@ res@@ sing my kids in his house , not the ja@@ il@@ house , making them feel a part of it .
so we started giving back .
and when you exp@@ and their pal@@ ates , you exp@@ and their vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary .
and again , when you can take kids from back@@ gro@@ unds as diver@@ se as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
people , you can all do that .
s@@ í se pu@@ e@@ de !
well , with the pi@@ g , at the bas@@ eline , before we blo@@ cked the pi@@ g &apos;s ar@@ tery to simu@@ late a heart attack , that was the signal .
so there it was , th@@ ur@@ s@@ day morning we stopped the pi@@ g &apos;s medic@@ ation and there is his electro@@ gra@@ m , the signal from inside the pi@@ g &apos;s heart coming out by radio tele@@ me@@ try .
that &apos;s the first invention that i wanted to describe .
st@@ acy sa@@ ger : but for christ@@ ina si@@ de@@ bottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migra@@ ine .
this is probably a better picture .
a signal in the brain that tri@@ g@@ gers brain dy@@ s@@ function might be sen@@ sed as a tri@@ g@@ ger for electro@@ -@@ stimu@@ lation like we &apos;re doing with epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy .
everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be inter@@ active with the patient , where they see the video and they &apos;re being video@@ ed and they press , do you understand this ? no , i don &apos;t .
and so there is a team of develop@@ ers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from mal@@ aw@@ i , from kenya .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over@@ load .
after he died , i realized that no one wri@@ tes to me anymore .
in fact , so many different points of res@@ on@@ ance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
think of it as a massive it@@ un@@ es for book type content .
companies like national instru@@ ments , who are em@@ bed@@ ding very powerful , inter@@ active simu@@ lations into the materials , so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of text@@ book to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do .
so what we &apos;re seeing is moving this burning or publi@@ cation process from the regular sort of sing@@ le-@@ auth@@ or@@ ed book towards commun@@ it@@ y-@@ auth@@ or@@ ed materials that are mod@@ ular , that are custom@@ i@@ zed to each individual class and published on demand very in@@ expen@@ si@@ vely , either pus@@ hed out through ama@@ zon , or published directly through an on-@@ demand press , like co@@ op .
and people who are teachers out here , who@@ ever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the inter@@ connections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
we &apos;re not talking about har@@ ry po@@ tter , right ?
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i qu@@ it the media lab .
and these are two an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es -- one was in cam@@ bo@@ dia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no tele@@ phone , but has broad@@ band internet now .
we &apos;re interested in big dis@@ plays , bright dis@@ plays .
it &apos;s the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating , because the rest of your laptop is de@@ vot@@ ed to itself .
is it all worked out ? no .
by law you &apos;ve got to bi@@ d , and so on and so forth .
because there &apos;s no market for post office tru@@ cks .
and if it comes out at 13@@ 8 dollars , so what ?
we can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get hea@@ vier , and then we can take anything out .
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot;
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
i want you to take a trip with me .
in resour@@ ce-@@ rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of babies are born hiv-@@ positive -- 9@@ 8 percent of babies are born hiv-@@ negative .
these women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it &apos;s not enough .
your baby is going to be hiv-@@ negative . &quot;
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more or@@ ph@@ ans .
she had been asked by one of the cli@@ ents to go to the home of the cli@@ ent , because the cli@@ ent wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and si@@ sters about her hiv status , and she was afraid to go by her@@ self .
we &apos;ve cho@@ sen to re@@ define the health care system as a doctor , a nur@@ se and a ment@@ or mother .
mothers with hiv car@@ ing for mothers with hiv .
it &apos;s propor@@ tion@@ ally much bigger in humans than in any other species , and it &apos;s involved in a whole range of high level cognitive fun@@ ctions , things like decisi@@ on-@@ making , planning , planning what you &apos;re going to do tomorrow or next week or next year , in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing in@@ appropriate behavior , so stopp@@ ing yourself saying something really ru@@ de or doing something really stupid .
there are three tru@@ cks there . you &apos;re going to instin@@ c@@ tively go for the white tru@@ ck , because that &apos;s the top tru@@ ck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , &quot; oh , he can &apos;t see that tru@@ ck , so he must mean me to move the blue tru@@ ck , &quot; which is the top tru@@ ck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make er@@ r@@ ors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lim@@ bi@@ c system , so i &apos;m going to show you the lim@@ bi@@ c system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
see , he ow@@ ned a chro@@ mi@@ um pl@@ ating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tan@@ ks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy li@@ f@@ ting .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flo@@ wers in a garden and then , basically , inde@@ x them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &apos;t .
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tel@@ e-@@ direc@@ tors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
human demon@@ stra@@ tions , they &apos;re all no@@ is@@ y and im@@ perfect , and we extra@@ ct from them an in@@ fer@@ red task tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory and control sequence for the robot .
the more that robots ing@@ rain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we &apos;re forced to exam@@ ine ourselves as people . at tedx@@ ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , ken gold@@ berg shares four very human lessons that he &apos;s learned from working with robots . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deep@@ est parts of our own humanity through our inter@@ actions with others .
and there was something so beauti@@ fully african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
as i come out of the water , sol@@ ly arri@@ ves at a deep section , a chan@@ nel between us .
she arrived at our reser@@ ve from a reser@@ ve east of us on her migr@@ atory rou@@ te .
and while it &apos;s true that u@@ bun@@ tu is an african idea , what i see is the essen@@ ce of that value being invented here .
now ka@@ es@@ a@@ va had a baby boy called re@@ han a couple of weeks ago .
perhaps loss of memory is so cru@@ cial for our survival as human beings .
well , when i think of the future , i never see myself moving forward in time . i actually see time moving back@@ ward towards me .
i actually inclu@@ ded stories from my grandmother .
i must ad@@ mit , i used to be one of them .
i discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way .
bir@@ ke ba@@ e@@ hr : what &apos;s wrong with our food system
and you can see that it kind of ho@@ ck@@ ey sti@@ cks up around the 196@@ 0s and &apos; 7@@ 0s , and it &apos;s on kind of a nice tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory right now .
se@@ amo@@ unts are important for bio@@ diversity .
and what &apos;s the context of the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x is@@ lands ?
i &apos;d like to go back and share it with the government of ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i , who are over in tar@@ a@@ wa , the west@@ ern@@ most group .
it had occur@@ red on land , in rain@@ fore@@ sts of south america and africa , where lan@@ dow@@ ners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
i &apos;ve just described to you the one story behind that rec@@ tan@@ g@@ ular area in the middle , the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x is@@ lands , but every other green pat@@ ch on that has its own story .
just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that , kind of , eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living . let me give you a couple examples .
in the short term , we can stimu@@ late job growth by encoura@@ ging entreprene@@ ur@@ ship and by invest@@ ing in infrastructure , because the robots today still aren &apos;t very good at fix@@ ing bri@@ d@@ ges .
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
thanks very much .
this is 198@@ 3 .
and , la@@ stly , under &quot; harmon@@ y , &quot; they had this 13@@ th-@@ century mand@@ ala from ti@@ bet .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be ar@@ re@@ sted , so he supp@@ lied everybody with this fa@@ ke volunte@@ er card .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
then it &apos;s : &quot; gu@@ ts . &quot;
the other condition is in societies living in mar@@ g@@ in@@ al or flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating environments , such as the arc@@ tic or deser@@ ts , where there are peri@@ o@@ di@@ c food shor@@ tages , and occasi@@ on@@ ally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive .
for example , there &apos;s particular em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on respect for the el@@ der@@ ly in east asia , associated with con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us &apos; doc@@ tr@@ ine of fi@@ li@@ al pie@@ ty , which means o@@ be@@ di@@ ence , respect and support for el@@ der@@ ly parents .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our el@@ der@@ ly are obje@@ c@@ tively less useful than in traditional societies .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
and so the back@@ story of the 99 takes place in 12@@ 5@@ 8 , which history tells us the mon@@ g@@ ols inv@@ aded bag@@ h@@ dad and destro@@ yed it .
the concept centers on something called the no@@ or st@@ ones .
i got acc@@ used in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the po@@ pe to pre@@ ach the trin@@ ity and ca@@ tho@@ lic@@ ism in the middle east , so you -- you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
top right is stu@@ art mo@@ ore , a writer for ir@@ on man .
opened a theme park through a licen@@ se in ku@@ wait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 square feet , 20 ri@@ des , all with our characters : a couple back@@ -@@ to-@@ school licen@@ ses in spa@@ in and tur@@ key .
i don &apos;t deser@@ ve it . i don &apos;t deser@@ ve anything .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day . red was made illegal .
ra@@ y@@ an re@@ fra@@ med the situation and brought himself down to my level .
that is , they &apos;re meaning@@ less without context : 500 billion for this pi@@ p@@ eline , 20 billion for this war .
so i want to show you another landscape now .
why apri@@ l ?
yeah , re@@ tail therapy might help .
there &apos;s something almost quite ma@@ gical about visual information .
so massive , in fact , that it can con@@ tain all the other military bud@@ gets in the world inside itself .
we need relative fig@@ ures that are connected to other data so that we can see a ful@@ ler picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective .
so let &apos;s filter that out .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
now what you are sm@@ elling is a combin@@ ation of -- i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reas@@ on@@ able theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
this is cis@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ en@@ e-@@ 1@@ -@@ ol . it sm@@ ells of cut gr@@ ass .
the bad news is they &apos;re ro@@ cket fu@@ els .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calcu@@ lation on that com@@ po@@ und , bottom right , which is related to cou@@ mar@@ in , but has an extra p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on in@@ ser@@ ted into the molecule .
i come out of the adverti@@ sing and design business .
running through this typical letter that they had , i ran it through my simpli@@ city lab , it &apos;s pretty un@@ intelli@@ gi@@ ble .
mo@@ ses ! -- the boys in michael mor@@ pur@@ go &apos;s &quot; friend or fo@@ e ; &quot; al@@ em in ben@@ jam@@ in ze@@ ph@@ ani@@ ah &apos;s &quot; re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e boy ; &quot; lu@@ ke sky@@ wal@@ ker -- lu@@ ke sky@@ wal@@ ker ! -- oli@@ ver twi@@ st ; cas@@ si@@ a in &quot; the con@@ cu@@ bine of shang@@ hai &quot; by h@@ ong ying ; cel@@ ie in ali@@ ce wal@@ ker &apos;s &quot; the color pur@@ ple . &quot;
the adop@@ tion process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , se@@ aled deal , an industri@@ ous , u@@ tili@@ t@@ arian solution : the government , the farmer , the adop@@ ting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the cro@@ p .
and i was on the c@@ us@@ p of , sort of , ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , so i was starting to take bis@@ cu@@ its from the tin without asking .
but because i had no family to in@@ qui@@ re about me , they could do anything to me .
le@@ m@@ n s@@ is@@ say : a child of the state
we still really haven &apos;t got a very complete picture of it .
and if you look north here , there &apos;s a big river that flo@@ ws into the la@@ ke that &apos;s been carrying se@@ di@@ ment and preser@@ ving the rema@@ ins of the animals that lived there .
and he rema@@ ined there until 1.@@ 6 million years later , when this very famous fossil h@@ unter , kam@@ o@@ ya ki@@ me@@ u , walked along a small h@@ ill@@ side and found that small piece of his sk@@ ul@@ l lying on the surface am@@ on@@ gst the pe@@ b@@ bles , recogni@@ zed it as being hom@@ in@@ id .
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think evolution@@ arily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
this fol@@ der has 17@@ ,000 photos -- over 20 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of information -- and it &apos;s growing constantly .
you can see that i even made a museum lab@@ el for it that inclu@@ des a brief history of the do@@ do .
it &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the ex@@ act same m@@ old that this one is .
i &apos;ll go you one stran@@ ger than that : in 197@@ 4 , during the production of a weird com@@ e@@ dy sequ@@ el to &quot; the mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on , &quot; called &quot; the black bird , &quot; star@@ ring george se@@ g@@ al , the los angeles coun@@ ty museum of art had a pla@@ ster original of the mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on -- one of the original six pla@@ sters , i think , made for the movie -- stol@@ en out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a publi@@ city st@@ unt for the movie .
there &apos;s a thing that happens when you m@@ old and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silic@@ one and cast it in res@@ in , you lose a little bit of volu@@ me , you lose a little bit of size .
i had exten@@ sive and life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening in@@ ju@@ ries .
the next conc@@ ern was whether i would walk again , because i was paraly@@ zed from the wa@@ ist down .
i was lying on a thin , hard spin@@ al bed .
in the spin@@ al ward , that &apos;s normal .
it was everybody &apos;s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circum@@ stances of my life .
and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short stra@@ ws .
so i went home , i got a training di@@ ary out , and i had a plan .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
and we should be developing things -- we should be developing pac@@ k@@ aging for ideas which el@@ ev@@ ate people &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and trans@@ late into products for everyday use .
when i do make some money , i &apos;ll have one machin@@ ed for myself .
it comes back to instin@@ ct .
it cost 1.@@ 7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by ber@@ n@@ hard@@ t , usa .
that is the power of organic design .
it &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
i &apos;ve been ban@@ ging on about this like i can &apos;t believe .
and that &apos;s what i do with my fur@@ ni@@ ture .
it &apos;s in not@@ ting h@@ ill next to all the cra@@ p -- you know , the pro@@ stit@@ utes and all that stuff .
on the wall is my book called &quot; super@@ natural , &quot; which allows me to remember what i &apos;ve done , because i forget .
we trained in a t@@ ank in port hu@@ ene@@ me , and then my first open ocean di@@ ve was in s@@ ant@@ a bar@@ bar@@ a chan@@ nel .
like those big explo@@ sions , spar@@ ks , are from a little com@@ b j@@ el@@ ly , and there &apos;s kri@@ ll and other kinds of cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans , and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
now , this one is blue , and that &apos;s the color of most bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence in the ocean because evolution has sel@@ ec@@ ted for the color that tra@@ vels far@@ th@@ est through se@@ a@@ water in order to optimi@@ ze communication .
he &apos;s got to find himself a bab@@ e and then he &apos;s got to lat@@ ch on for life .
and then to generate the display you &apos;re about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its ner@@ ve ring with a shar@@ p pick that &apos;s sort of like the shar@@ p to@@ oth of a fish .
but there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : glo@@ wing life in an under@@ water world
so as we are facing all the multiple cris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gra@@ titude , effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
so i -- i took my camera , i took my not@@ e@@ book , took a chair , and started to obser@@ ve this behavior .
here &apos;s one of my fellow w@@ inn@@ ers . that &apos;s charles pa@@ x@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &quot; cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p behavior of o@@ stri@@ ches towards humans under far@@ ming conditions in britain . &quot;
the mis@@ sion@@ ary position is very rare in the animal king@@ dom .
and when it &apos;s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a si@@ x-@@ course du@@ ck dinner .
it had become a part of my body , an exten@@ sion of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my offi@@ cial image .
prin@@ ce charles has some simil@@ ari@@ ties with ni@@ co@@ le kid@@ man .
and the good thing about percei@@ ving ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day to sun@@ ba@@ the , because ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to percei@@ ve things that we cannot percei@@ ve .
she was wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ concerned about the be@@ ars , but she was terri@@ fied of law@@ yers .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &apos;t usually win .
it &apos;s very hard to measure because there are mix@@ ed mo@@ tives .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to re@@ build these boundar@@ ies .
that person doesn &apos;t exist today .
it &apos;s the only way to get our freedom back , and it &apos;s the only way to rele@@ ase the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let &apos;s see if we can come up with some really clever in@@ centi@@ ves so that , even if the people we deal with don &apos;t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic in@@ centi@@ ves that will get people to do the right thing even out of p@@ ure sel@@ fis@@ hn@@ ess .
well if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure out round colum@@ ns using a rul@@ er .
he had a pretty low-@@ wa@@ ge job .
he did after all have a to@@ y gun .
but the problem with rel@@ ying on rules and in@@ centi@@ ves is that they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity , and they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity in two senses .
so can@@ ny out@@ laws are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine any can@@ ny out@@ law susta@@ ining that for an in@@ defini@@ te period of time .
there are now 22 cities that have veter@@ ans &apos; cour@@ ts like this .
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
the united states had developed a couple of atom@@ ic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : we would use the power of the at@@ om to end the at@@ ro@@ cities and the hor@@ ror of this un@@ en@@ ding world war ii that we &apos;d been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
during this chap@@ ter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear cat@@ astrop@@ he , and an inde@@ li@@ ble image was implan@@ ted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st would be absolutely glob@@ ally de@@ struc@@ tive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it .
so the goal was to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate the target cities .
there are many , many sites where war@@ heads are stor@@ ed and , in fact , lots of sites where fis@@ sion@@ able materials , like highly en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um and plu@@ ton@@ ium , are absolutely not safe .
they are very de@@ dic@@ ated and commit@@ ted .
this is the size of the &quot; little boy &quot; bom@@ b that was dro@@ pped at hi@@ ro@@ shi@@ ma .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do -- and i mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the bl@@ ast .
so separ@@ ation -- hopefully with di@@ rt or con@@ cre@@ te , or being in a bas@@ ement -- distance and time is what will save you .
serious problems , big problems , pres@@ sing problems .
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
and that &apos;s clear@@ er now than it &apos;s been for decades .
that &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit .
business does not profit from caus@@ ing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
we see companies like the brazi@@ li@@ an fore@@ stry company fi@@ bri@@ a that &apos;s figured out how to avoid te@@ aring down old growth forest and using eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus and getting much more y@@ i@@ el@@ d per he@@ ct@@ are of pul@@ p and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
if we can break down this sort of divi@@ de , this un@@ e@@ ase , this ten@@ sion , this sense that we &apos;re not fundament@@ ally collabor@@ ating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
this shows a lot of intern@@ al structures .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dis@@ section .
they &apos;re even more sho@@ cked by what he says .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
each month requi@@ red 1,@@ 3@@ 65 calcu@@ lations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
there &apos;s a fli@@ p side as well .
one day a nasa man@@ ager comes into my office , si@@ ts down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &apos;t .
and it is in fact due to this arms race between ha@@ ck@@ ers and operating system designers that things go back and forth .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spre@@ ading .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equ@@ ally frequ@@ ent .
it doesn &apos;t matter what kind of se@@ di@@ ment you &apos;re using to gr@@ ind up , whether it &apos;s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
so let &apos;s see what that looks like .
and if we re@@ move the myster@@ y of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
this is a paper form , and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a mini@@ stry of health nur@@ se in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia who is tra@@ mp@@ ing out across the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and hu@@ mi@@ d day , and she is going to be kno@@ cking on thousands of do@@ ors over a period of weeks or months , kno@@ cking on the do@@ ors and saying , &quot; exc@@ use me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
now try and wra@@ p your head around that for a second .
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this p@@ ace , over my whole career , maybe i &apos;m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
now you may not think of hot@@ mail as being mira@@ cul@@ ous , but for me it was mira@@ cul@@ ous , because i noticed , just as i was w@@ rest@@ ling with this problem , i was working in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa mostly at the time .
but there are some addi@@ tional benefits as well .
colle@@ cting global health data was an im@@ perfect science : workers tra@@ mp@@ ed through villa@@ ges to kno@@ ck on do@@ ors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data -- and from this ga@@ pp@@ y information , countries would make huge decisions . data ge@@ ek jo@@ el sel@@ ani@@ ki@@ o talks through the sea change in colle@@ cting health data in the past decade -- starting with the pal@@ m pilot and hot@@ mail , and now moving into the cloud . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and when we drop the ball@@ ast over@@ board we clim@@ b .
thro@@ wing over@@ board , as ball@@ ast , to change our direction .
but we were expected to have dou@@ b@@ ts ; we &apos;re expected to have fe@@ ars .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
but much more , to get ad@@ vices , to give your comm@@ ents , to spread the word that if it &apos;s possible in the air , of course it &apos;s possible in the ground .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a produ@@ cer .
don &apos;t ask .
and what we &apos;re facing in africa is an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented threat to human dig@@ ni@@ ty and equ@@ ality .
you see , it &apos;s not as dra@@ matic as the tsun@@ ami .
don &apos;t you think that on a pur@@ ely commercial level , that anti-@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs are great adverti@@ se@@ ments for western in@@ genu@@ ity and technology ?
this is the straight truth , the ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous truth .
so why , then , are we not pump@@ ing our fi@@ sts into the air ?
moment@@ um has been building .
there &apos;s the continent africa .
a few minutes ago , i talked about all the citizens &apos; campaig@@ ns that are spr@@ inging up .
i really believe that old tru@@ man line , that if you give the american people the facts , they &apos;ll do the right thing .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
now , &quot; all sho@@ ok up &quot; is a great love song .
people with color@@ ed hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
they took longer to re@@ je@@ ct metaph@@ ors as fal@@ se than they did to re@@ je@@ ct literally fal@@ se sent@@ ences .
those ex@@ posed to the world war ii scen@@ ari@@ o made more interven@@ tion@@ ist re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tions than the others .
a@@ ph@@ or@@ ism enth@@ usi@@ ast and auth@@ or james ge@@ ary wa@@ xes on a fascinating fix@@ ture of human language : the metaphor . friend of scri@@ bes from ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le to el@@ v@@ is , metaphor can sub@@ tly influence the decisions we make , ge@@ ary says .
but we want to tell the world that , no , under the one fla@@ g , we &apos;ll still re@@ main as ye@@ men@@ i people .
and he said , &quot; you are the bridge . &quot;
p@@ m : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
we &apos;ve suff@@ ered pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tion ; the paper was closed down more than three times .
actually , that &apos;s a docum@@ ent@@ ary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
as political tur@@ mo@@ il in ye@@ men continu@@ es , the edi@@ tor of the ye@@ men times , na@@ dia al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f , talks at ted@@ global with ho@@ st p@@ at mit@@ ch@@ ell . al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f &apos;s independent , engli@@ sh@@ -@@ language paper is vi@@ tal for sharing news -- and for sharing a new vision of ye@@ men and of that country &apos;s women as equal part@@ ners in work and change .
my father and my grand@@ father were always looking for the ne@@ west thing in alternative or traditional therap@@ ies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small h@@ ill . i couldn &apos;t clim@@ b a flight of sta@@ irs .
it certainly didn &apos;t pre@@ p@@ are me for what came next .
my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transp@@ l@@ ant .
but organs don &apos;t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
medical conditions don &apos;t ne@@ gate the human condition .
and many of these chemicals are now lin@@ ked to the sky@@ rock@@ eting inci@@ dents of chr@@ onic childhood disease that we &apos;re seeing across industri@@ alized nations .
and you can see these large , yo@@ l@@ ke@@ d-@@ up eg@@ gs bur@@ sting through the surface of this male &apos;s te@@ stes .
but just two weeks before that , the u.s. sen@@ ate re@@ f@@ used to even debate the ban@@ ning of b@@ pa in babies &apos; bot@@ tles and si@@ pp@@ y cu@@ ps .
in addition to that , after the baby &apos;s born , our other unique invention as ma@@ mm@@ als is that we n@@ our@@ ish our off@@ spring after they &apos;re born .
th : one of this things that &apos;s exciting and appropriate for me to be here at ted@@ women is that , well , i think it was su@@ mm@@ ed up best last night at dinner when someone said , &quot; turn to the man at your table and tell them , &apos; when the revolution starts , we &apos;ve got your back . &apos; &quot; the truth is , women , you &apos;ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with ra@@ ch@@ el car@@ son &apos;s &quot; sil@@ ent spring &quot; to the@@ o col@@ born &apos;s &quot; our stol@@ en future &quot; to sand@@ ra stein@@ gr@@ aber &apos;s books &quot; living down@@ stream &quot; and &quot; having faith . &quot;
and it &apos;s my feeling and it &apos;s my ur@@ ging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communic@@ ators of this , but also as the ones who carry that bur@@ den of carrying the children , be@@ aring the children , we hold most of the buying power in the hou@@ se@@ hold , is that it &apos;s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of ty@@ r@@ one and other scientists around the world .
here is a remote island re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory for bot@@ tles off the coast of ba@@ ja california .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
all the king &apos;s hor@@ ses and all the king &apos;s men ...

and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to fre@@ e-@@ clim@@ b a red@@ wood without rop@@ es or any equipment to see what was up there .
when steve sil@@ le@@ tt gets up into a big red@@ wood , he fir@@ es an ar@@ row , which tra@@ ils a fishing line , which gets over a bran@@ ch in the tree , and then you as@@ c@@ end up a rop@@ e which has been dra@@ g@@ ged into the tree by the line .
this rei@@ ter@@ ation is a huge flying bu@@ t@@ tr@@ ess that comes out the tree itself .
they &apos;re finding out that red@@ wo@@ ods can move mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure out of the air and down into their tr@@ un@@ ks , possibly all the way into their ro@@ ot systems .
what can the red@@ wo@@ ods tell us about ourselves ?
richard pre@@ ston , thank you very much , i think .
the p@@ c virus problem is 25 years old now .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centi@@ pe@@ de sc@@ roll@@ ing across your computer when you get infe@@ cted by this one .
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your online ban@@ king accoun@@ ts when you do online ban@@ king , or key@@ log@@ gers .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
and that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
now i &apos;m not a law@@ yer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &quot; i rest my case . &quot;
so prepar@@ e@@ dness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted aren &apos;t there .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
and many of you may have noticed that doesn &apos;t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have .
we &apos;ve increas@@ ed it to 3@@ .@@ 6 million .
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here .
and down at 100 they would build civili@@ an nuclear energy , which is what they say is their obje@@ ctive .
everything is not predic@@ table : the stock market is , at least for me , not predic@@ table , but most complicated negoti@@ ations are predic@@ table .
whether you &apos;re an artist , a technolog@@ ist , a law@@ yer or a fan , the hand@@ ling of copy@@ right directly im@@ pac@@ ts your life .
and then they benefit through the ex@@ pos@@ ure , adverti@@ sing and lin@@ ked sal@@ es .
there &apos;s musical lab@@ els .
if you saw these women on the street in their fa@@ ded clo@@ th@@ es , you might dis@@ miss them as poor and simple .
sat@@ aw@@ al is one hal@@ f-@@ mile long by one mile wide .
this is part of our collective narra@@ tive .
it &apos;s the most important map of all .
you don &apos;t work in your self-@@ interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wir@@ ing changes in the way it fun@@ ctions .
so , i &apos;ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what &apos;s the difference in somebody &apos;s life if you look at somebody like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 10@@ 0-@@ dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them .
the defin@@ ing factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
hon@@ est@@ ly , better or worse ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s sha@@ ping us .
how many of you here love surpris@@ es ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don &apos;t get a c@@ at . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
now , 18 years later , i &apos;m proud to tell you , last year we f@@ ed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation , all during the ho@@ li@@ days : th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , christ@@ mas -- -- in all the different countries around the world .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &quot; hon@@ ey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to mar@@ ry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; she was as@@ le@@ ep , because it was 3 a@@ .@@ m@@ . for us , when he called her back from the top and said , &quot; hon@@ ey , i can &apos;t tell you what this means . &quot;
and that was lar@@ gely because there weren &apos;t any .
and we define ourselves by our g@@ ap@@ s .
any do@@ t can be cli@@ cked and exp@@ and@@ ed . and we see here , &quot; i would just feel so much better if i could cur@@ l up in his arms right now and feel his affe@@ ction for me in the embra@@ ce of his body and the ten@@ der@@ ness of his li@@ ps . &quot;
the next movement is called mo@@ bs .
here we see people that feel &quot; sli@@ pping , &quot; &quot; n@@ au@@ se@@ ous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
it &apos;s called universe : reve@@ aling our modern my@@ th@@ ology .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
here we have our star field . here we have our shapes .
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
what would that mean ? i have no idea .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by she@@ aring win@@ ds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer diff@@ er signific@@ antly , and in the middle , in between , you get this und@@ ul@@ ating of the air , and if the difference in those spee@@ ds is just right , the tops of the un@@ du@@ lations cur@@ l over in these beautiful breaking wa@@ ve-@@ like vor@@ tic@@ es .
the shar@@ p , cris@@ p out@@ lines of this forma@@ tion make it the best one for finding shapes in .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data , ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of data and extra@@ cting the relevant information .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing of x-@@ ra@@ ys on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it &apos;s fully inter@@ active , so you can ro@@ tate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so mot@@ ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activ@@ ated on the motor cortex .
i can pe@@ el off the layer of the li@@ on .
and so it was simply ast@@ on@@ ishing to me to find an organization that actually appreci@@ ated both those sides .
he said , &quot; ok . i measu@@ red the hei@@ ght of a bri@@ ck .
the standard explan@@ ation is that the universe somehow spr@@ ang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary energy -- which ble@@ w it up .
the den@@ sity of matter is fin@@ ite , and we have a chance of a consi@@ stent set of equ@@ ations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s g@@ dp in 1960 , around the time of indepen@@ dence for many african states .
and to my ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ment , they bac@@ ked me 100 percent .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lec@@ tur@@ ers and students -- and it &apos;s not surprising at all to find an impro@@ mp@@ tu tu@@ tor@@ ial at 1 a@@ .@@ m .
i will be atten@@ ding a@@ ims .
i want to point out a few other ex@@ cep@@ tional people in this picture .
and our part@@ ners across africa are extremely enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic about this .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .
and let me just sum@@ mar@@ ize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
now , what &apos;s happening is that as transi@@ stors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer be@@ have like this .
ok , so a computer pi@@ cks a specific it@@ em of data from memory , it sen@@ ds it into the process@@ or or the al@@ u , and then it puts the result back into memory .
this is kar@@ e@@ em &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
so , despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s super@@ massive , and i &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size .
i need to understand the mass of the object i &apos;m cla@@ im@@ ing is a black hole , and what its schwarz@@ schil@@ d radi@@ us is .
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from .
which is the job that i have to show you today .
you &apos;re seeing an anima@@ tion that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this techni@@ que -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is cen@@ ter@@ ed on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
and because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
in fact , we anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that star forma@@ tion shouldn &apos;t proce@@ ed in that environment .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascin@@ ates me .
but the way we re@@ act to different combin@@ ations of these phenomen@@ a is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
but every musi@@ cian stri@@ kes a different balance between faith and reason , instin@@ ct and intelligence .
it &apos;s the time in which the big forms began to ar@@ ise .
the culture in which we live now is a@@ was@@ h with music of impro@@ vis@@ ation that &apos;s been sli@@ ced , di@@ ced , la@@ y@@ ered and , god knows , distribu@@ ted and sold .
and it exc@@ ites me now to meet people who are hi@@ kers , che@@ fs , code wri@@ ters , tax@@ i dri@@ vers , people i never would have gu@@ essed who loved the music and who are pas@@ sing it on .
the real key obser@@ vation he made is that a fre@@ e-@@ flying wing can swe@@ ep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fix@@ e@@ d-@@ wing tur@@ bine .
if you give me a 7@@ 4@@ 7 , i &apos;ll make six me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts , which is more than the largest wind tur@@ bin@@ es today .
that comes from the last name of one of sch@@ um@@ ann &apos;s female friends .
and then you have to do the ini@@ tial sk@@ et@@ ch of the character , which is like your structure of a piece , and then you add pen and pen@@ cil and whatever details that you need -- that &apos;s poli@@ sh@@ ing the drawing .
now , she cho@@ se c , g , b , a , e .
it felt like a revolution .
it &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
it &apos;s by giving away what you think is your deep@@ est secret that maybe millions of people are em@@ powered to help improve it .
but what &apos;s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work out@@ put is of the type that can be easily shared digit@@ ally -- a picture , a music fi@@ le , software .
there &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
it &apos;s right here .
schools can &apos;t be si@@ los .
the same tr@@ ash site is fe@@ eding more than 30 families .
now , to make this more con@@ cre@@ te , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statisti@@ cally stick out in the most favorite ted@@ talks and in the least favorite ted@@ talks .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speak@@ ers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glas@@ ses and be slightly more d@@ res@@ se@@ d-@@ up than the average ted speak@@ er .
so i &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in inter@@ acting with other people , i &apos;m going to completely stri@@ p it of all its complic@@ ating fe@@ atures , and i &apos;m going to turn that object , that simpli@@ fied object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early st@@ ages , em@@ br@@ y@@ onic st@@ ages of new insi@@ ghts into what happens in two brains while they simul@@ tane@@ ously interact .
drugs of ab@@ use would come in , and they would change the way you value the world . they change the way you value the sym@@ b@@ ols associated with your drug of choice , and they make you value that over everything else .
and the short answer is games .
can@@ aries used to be used as kind of bio@@ sensor@@ s in min@@ es .
read mon@@ ta@@ gue : what we &apos;re learning from 5,000 brains
politics and politicians will only succe@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
right now , here we are lin@@ ked up to long beach and everywhere else , and all these secret lo@@ cations for a fra@@ ction of that cost , and we can send and recei@@ ve huge quanti@@ ties of information without it co@@ sting anything .
and you can see this looks a bit like a che@@ f &apos;s hat , but actually that &apos;s an as@@ sau@@ lt , the one in blue .
obviously , here we have j@@ f@@ k with that incredibly simple and powerful for@@ mu@@ lation , &quot; ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredibly no@@ ble sen@@ ti@@ ment .
how would i know who was the best ?
some teachers are far more effective than others .
you can &apos;t really dis@@ pu@@ te what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a prof@@ ession when we actually get to see this .
that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own class@@ rooms , and they pick the lessons they want to sub@@ mit , a lot of them will be e@@ ager to participa@@ te .
it &apos;s a movement that -- it ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates making biot@@ echn@@ ology acc@@ essi@@ ble to everyone , not just scientists and people in government lab@@ s .
then we like to take things apart .
let me show you what you could do right now .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
but you know what ?
we &apos;re going to hear from two people who are on the shar@@ p end of the law .
because i am hiv positive .
now drug use or pos@@ s@@ ession is illegal in almost every country .
we can also train jud@@ ges so that they find flexi@@ bilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of toler@@ ance rather than pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
the office building is basically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te for doing private work .
this is even a more interesting solution in se@@ ou@@ l , korea .
we hope to have that built this fall .
we don &apos;t really believe in c@@ ameras to do things in homes .
and they are thought to be able to filter a cu@@ bi@@ c kilometer of water every hour and can feed on 30 kil@@ os of zo@@ o plan@@ k@@ ton a day to survive .
we &apos;re often all fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of sharks thanks to &quot; ja@@ ws . &quot;
it might be a change in the distribution of plan@@ k@@ ton .
i &apos;ll show you what they look like .
so very simple things like that , we &apos;re trying to learn about bas@@ king sharks .
but again , it &apos;s kind of surprising . you wouldn &apos;t really expect that .
that &apos;s ban@@ ned now , and that &apos;ll be good news for the sharks .
and they sat on it for months actually .
you probably saw the hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ale foot@@ age that we got there a month or two ago off coun@@ ty we@@ x@@ ford .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
they got themselves ready .
so with my hidden inten@@ tion , i kept quie@@ t .
but again , i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence .
how did you end up in ja@@ il ? this was just a few weeks ago , i believe , yeah ?
does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ gation right now ?
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know that i was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
i was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
life magazine introduced generations of people to dist@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cultures they never knew exi@@ sted through pictures .
this is my contribu@@ tion to the civil rights fight of my generation .
once they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks .
it &apos;s too late .
appar@@ ently , lu@@ ci@@ fer means &quot; the light . &quot;
all of them come from the c@@ ameras of american soldiers .
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad ap@@ ples .
this is stan@@ ley mil@@ gra@@ m , little je@@ wish kid from the bronx , and he asked the question , &quot; could the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st happen here , now ? &quot;
you &apos;re a good person . you com@@ pla@@ in .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
they &apos;re going to become numbers .

wes@@ ley and the guy -- 20 and a half in@@ ches hei@@ ght .
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create .
and of course consider images that can be sensor@@ y patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or audi@@ tory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
very od@@ d -- i &apos;ve analy@@ zed this for a while .
and i thought about a solution to this problem .
you have , in effect , lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem .
except that they &apos;re not as rich as ours , because they don &apos;t have a cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex like we do .
we should look at how society and culture in this soci@@ o-@@ cultural regu@@ lation are a work in progress .
my dad actually res@@ ig@@ ned from the mal@@ e-@@ only business club in my home@@ town because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day wel@@ come his son , but not his daughter .
i say , &quot; online organi@@ zing . &quot;
x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia &apos;s on the rise . the traff@@ i@@ cking of women and girls .
many of them are working in deeply in@@ tra@@ c@@ table systems -- the military , con@@ gress , the education system , etc .
the ma@@ x@@ im , &quot; know th@@ y@@ self &quot; has been around since the ancient gre@@ e@@ ks .
this is the term that ar@@ mi@@ es use when they &apos;ve lost a battle .
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am , so i can put my level of attention into the circu@@ it board on the other side .
we created the respon@@ sive room where the lights music and blin@@ ds ad@@ ju@@ sted to your state .
normally we think about technology as inter@@ active .
with human@@ i@@ zed technology we can monit@@ or the quality of your sleep cy@@ cles .
ar@@ iel garten : know th@@ y@@ self , with a brain scan@@ ner
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
and with the same do@@ g@@ ged determin@@ ation that my father had b@@ red into me since i was such a child -- he taught me how to sa@@ il , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the sh@@ ore , and i couldn &apos;t see the sa@@ ils , and i couldn &apos;t see the dest@@ ination .
and you all know what it is . you don &apos;t need to have a dis@@ ability to know that .
and he said , &quot; do you love it ? &quot;
and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it .
and i set up kan@@ ch@@ i , because my organization was always going to be named after my eleph@@ ant , because dis@@ ability is like the eleph@@ ant in the room .
and stop with the lab@@ els , the limit@@ ing .
the reason , i think , is that the pen@@ sion@@ ers believe they &apos;ve cho@@ sen to be pen@@ sion@@ ers , whereas the young un@@ emplo@@ yed feel it &apos;s been thr@@ ust upon them .
do you call it the ba@@ il@@ out of gre@@ e@@ ce or the ba@@ il@@ out of a load of stupid ban@@ ks which l@@ ent to gre@@ e@@ ce ?
and i think that &apos;s probably right .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a port@@ al .
if you &apos;re on the way to visit your mother in-@@ law , you &apos;d probably pre@@ fer to stay on the left .
there &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of du@@ bi@@ ous value , which you create by changing the way people look at things .
i would argue , in britain there &apos;s a much better frame of re@@ ference , which is to tell people that more fir@@ st-@@ class mail arri@@ ves the next day in the u.k. than in germany .
and within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over@@ -@@ sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed lives .
hi . so , this cha@@ p here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
these drugs were brought to market . they were pres@@ cri@@ bed very wid@@ ely because heart attac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increas@@ ed rate of death that before we dete@@ cted that safety signal , over 100,000 people died un@@ necessarily in america from the pres@@ cri@@ ption of anti-@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mic drugs .
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
and the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suff@@ er fa@@ ke fi@@ xes .
nasa suppor@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the ha@@ y@@ den planet@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network dom@@ es .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been enga@@ ged in a field called active music .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &apos;s can still respond to .
the main sing@@ er disappe@@ ars at the beginning of the oper@@ a and the entire stage becomes the main character . it becomes his leg@@ acy .
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that &apos;s a personal relationship to expression that is l@@ ac@@ king in the technologi@@ cal sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to per@@ form .
do you remember the story of o@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ us and the si@@ r@@ ens from high school or j@@ uni@@ or high school ?
if you do that tomorrow , i &apos;ll be dead , you &apos;ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead .
it has these strong , hero@@ ic arms that can li@@ ft dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts into your mouth .
on average , it was just a completely poin@@ t@@ less exchange of money that i would re@@ gre@@ t .
we look at the sav@@ ings rate and it has been dec@@ lin@@ ing since the 195@@ 0s .
yes , this person reti@@ red at 150 percent of their working income in reti@@ re@@ ment .
and from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in rever@@ se .
and just for ki@@ cks we ran his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .
also , those very sounds tend not to be repres@@ ented by the characters that are available in european languages .
even in the be@@ st-@@ resour@@ ced countries in the world , this life expec@@ tan@@ cy gap is as much as 20 years .
in z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , for example , there were just about a do@@ zen psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , most of whom lived and worked in har@@ are city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
for me , what &apos;s truly s@@ und@@ ar about the idea of task shif@@ ting , though , isn &apos;t that it simply makes health care more acc@@ essi@@ ble and aff@@ ord@@ able but that it is also fundament@@ ally em@@ power@@ ing .
we began the project with an inter@@ im report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been colle@@ cted on the subject by many , many researchers .
but when did a be@@ e actually ever give you an inv@@ o@@ ice ?
now i &apos;m going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
if you dri@@ ll water to make co@@ ke near a village farm , that &apos;s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
and the chinese government respon@@ ded sensi@@ bly and placed a ban on f@@ elling .
it &apos;s about energy emissions .
we &apos;ve actually kind of made an eth@@ ical choice in society to not have coral re@@ ef@@ s .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
fe@@ yn@@ man loved this story .
but it was really bru@@ tal .
we were up in the mountains , 197@@ 6 .
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .
he would try to visu@@ alize it , gui@@ ded by a small number of simple principles .
if you could do all of them , you would have a very pre@@ cise theory .
how should we really honor fe@@ yn@@ man ?
it &apos;s a com@@ po@@ und cur@@ ve inter@@ ior .
so the problem became -- and they set this dile@@ m@@ ma to me -- that you have to design the inter@@ ior using only our exi@@ sting technology , and there &apos;s no money for to@@ ol@@ ing or mol@@ ding .
and despite all of our best eff@@ or@@ ts and inten@@ tions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
i first saw this in a can@@ adi@@ an film board film when i was 10 , and it left a la@@ sting impres@@ sion , to see babies playing with kni@@ ves .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on it@@ un@@ es , write it to a c@@ d , then ri@@ p the c@@ d to an mp@@ 3 and play it on your very same computer .
so this motiv@@ ated me to become an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surge@@ on and to see if i couldn &apos;t focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing spor@@ ts and not li@@ mit me .
well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough don@@ or cy@@ cles .
so that &apos;s our bi@@ ologi@@ c approach right now .
and it wouldn &apos;t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a fla@@ g that was car@@ ried to the moon and back , on apo@@ ll@@ o 11 .
more tomorrow . i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures .
so hopefully tomorrow i &apos;ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
but i brought along here a l@@ um@@ p of coal -- right here , one l@@ um@@ p of coal .
when e@@ dis@@ on invented the light bul@@ b , pretty much looked like this .
but they want to use it -- seriously .
we &apos;re also working on noise can@@ cel@@ ing things like s@@ nor@@ ing , noise from automo@@ bil@@ es .
i said we can sh@@ orten the colum@@ n , we can spread it out to cover the cou@@ ch .
i have a bunch of other inven@@ tions .
getting it over there ?
so i exist some@@ what outside of the main@@ stream of design thinking .
to this end , i have worked in sugar for ste@@ fan sa@@ g@@ meister , three-@@ time ted speak@@ er .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an inter@@ mission in my talk .
&quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can as@@ sure you that this qu@@ ir@@ k you &apos;re so self-@@ conscious of is inten@@ sely en@@ de@@ aring .
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &apos;re not contribu@@ ting enough , or worse , that all we &apos;re doing is contribu@@ ting to land@@ fill .
re@@ zero kee@@ ps his balance by constantly meas@@ uring his pit@@ ch angle with a sen@@ sor .
with a screen it could in@@ form people or show them around in a fun and entertain@@ ing way .
and so , going back to this ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , bes@@ i@@ des being nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female ab@@ alone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; this is how to build an ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te material .
the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell here -- and if you fra@@ c@@ ture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured .
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
i brought it here .
angel@@ a bel@@ cher : using nature to grow bat@@ ter@@ ies
and then you &apos;ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the com@@ mu@@ te .
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , progra@@ mm@@ ers , wri@@ ters , engineers , thin@@ kers -- that people really need long stre@@ t@@ ches of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted time to get something done .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being inter@@ rup@@ ted all day at the office ?
that &apos;s kind of ridi@@ cul@@ ous . it &apos;s a total de@@ co@@ y .
i mean , what are the chan@@ ces that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
because the off@@ ices are well equi@@ pped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
you can qu@@ it i@@ .@@ m@@ . ; you can &apos;t hi@@ de your man@@ ager .
this is my office . it &apos;s out there .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if i wanted to .
i think , quite a nice fe@@ ature .
so , we &apos;ve been conduc@@ ting a lot of research .
it brings ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary ban@@ king services to places where there &apos;s no ban@@ king infrastructure .
like , this is vi@@ a@@ gr@@ a that i bought from a back@@ street sex shop in china .
for me , this kind of person@@ i@@ fi@@ es this connected world , where everything is inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , and the dots are -- it &apos;s all about the dots jo@@ ining together .
and , with that , comes the third point , which is ob@@ li@@ gation -- and an ob@@ li@@ gation to that avail@@ ability .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what were we just talking about ?
de@@ an or@@ nis@@ h shares new research that shows how adop@@ ting healthy lifest@@ yle hab@@ its can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live heal@@ thi@@ er , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase .
this idea is ni@@ c@@ ely cap@@ tured by this quote : &quot; things without all reme@@ dy should be without reg@@ ard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot;
these are the classi@@ c conditions that create re@@ gre@@ t .
but it turns out that re@@ gre@@ t feels awful in four very specific and consi@@ stent ways .
make it go away . make it go away . &quot;
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have ir@@ re@@ vo@@ c@@ able and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people &apos;s health and happiness and li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods , and in the very worst case scen@@ ari@@ o , even their lives .
when other people see my tat@@ too , for the most part they like how it looks .
thank you .
half of them gave over the internet .
and pretty soon , the average price was 19@@ 2 dollars .
today these low pri@@ ces are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 6@@ 2 countries , and about 5@@ 5@@ 0,000 people are getting the benefits of them .
recently we did an ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation of the first 18 months of our eff@@ or@@ ts in r@@ wand@@ a .
that &apos;s about 4@@ 3 percent of all the preg@@ nan@@ cies .
i am gr@@ ate@@ ful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
the class@@ rooms have no walls .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
this was a great thing .
this young man is pi@@ cking organic vege@@ tables .
and together these volunte@@ ers and the teachers are deeply commit@@ ted to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
is this do@@ able in your community ?
cha@@ z e@@ bert : it was cha@@ z who stood by my side through three attemp@@ ts to re@@ constru@@ ct my ja@@ w and re@@ store my ability to speak .
then i tried typ@@ ing words on my laptop and using its built in voice .
they &apos;d never made one from previ@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ recor@@ ded materials .
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with buil@@ t-@@ in speaking systems .
the initi@@ als stood for progra@@ mm@@ ed lo@@ gic for auto@@ ma@@ ted teaching oper@@ ations .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
sometimes they assu@@ me i am dea@@ f .
a guy goes into a psychiat@@ r@@ ist .
so what can we do ?
other examples you can see here are from lat@@ via , li@@ th@@ u@@ ania , est@@ on@@ ia -- the central european countries .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
you will rec@@ all that in 197@@ 6 , jun@@ e 16 , the students of south africa bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ ted the language of afri@@ ka@@ ans as the medium of the op@@ pres@@ sor , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afri@@ ka@@ ans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ?
she ended up underneath the car .
and i ended up with a plastic nose , por@@ cel@@ a@@ in teeth and all kinds of other things .
so they eventually started mat@@ ching their tal@@ ents and skills to all of my needs .
so i moved on from there .
and as a blind person , your visual memory fa@@ des and is re@@ placed with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell .
and he wrote to the acade@@ mi@@ cians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
and i think g@@ ali@@ le@@ o su@@ mm@@ ed up , very ni@@ c@@ ely , the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us .
but i wanted to try and en@@ rich him .
so i &apos;m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathema@@ tically -- so bra@@ ce y@@ ourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which en@@ ables us to capture what is symme@@ try .
so both of these objects have six symme@@ tries .
let &apos;s do a ro@@ tation by a third of a turn an@@ tic@@ lo@@ ck@@ wise , and refle@@ ct in the line through x .
but the shapes match up if i ro@@ tate by a six@@ th of a turn around the point where all the tri@@ an@@ gles meet .
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , exc@@ ell@@ ent .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really the essen@@ ce of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
but i think from the point of view of a ne@@ anderth@@ al , there would have been a lot of dis@@ appro@@ val of the wi@@ mp@@ ish ch@@ op@@ pers that we now have .
and mark t@@ wa@@ in , who knew all about typ@@ es@@ et@@ ting , really was s@@ mitten by this machine .
and my favorite example of that occur@@ red beginning in 197@@ 6 , when it was discovered that the bacteria caus@@ ing legi@@ on@@ na@@ ires disease had always been present in natural wat@@ ers , but it was the pre@@ cise temperature of the water in he@@ ating , venti@@ l@@ ating and air condi@@ tion@@ ing systems that raised the right temperature for the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um re@@ production of legi@@ on@@ ell@@ a bac@@ ill@@ us .
think of the financial world , for example .
for some reason , there &apos;s no standard sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us , there &apos;s no basic course .
here &apos;s something that dri@@ ves me crazy .
you get it every time .
and instead of that point and click , it &apos;s like a push and pull , things colli@@ de as you &apos;d expect them . just like on my real des@@ k , i can -- let me just gra@@ b these guys -- i can turn things into pil@@ es instead of just the fol@@ ders that we have .
i think you can really en@@ rich the way we brow@@ se our photographs and bring it to that kind of sho@@ e@@ box of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
let me introdu@@ ce you to my brand new project , &quot; b@@ aro@@ que in rock , &quot; which became a golden dis@@ c most recently .
they ac@@ qui@@ re the sensi@@ bility of truth because they repe@@ at over and over again , and they o@@ ssi@@ fy and cal@@ ci@@ fy , and they become real .
and i said , &quot; what &apos;s the black box for wall street ? &quot;
and the ga@@ g is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
and the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t google .
we &apos;re designing for this machine di@@ ale@@ ct .
it invol@@ ves light con@@ es and quant@@ um ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ment , and i don &apos;t really understand any of that .
this much , right ?
j@@ s : cu@@ ts itself .
fif@@ ty percent of cr@@ as@@ hes happen at inter@@ se@@ ctions .
add that together with the gas , and it &apos;s $ 1@@ 12@@ ,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
when people come to an un@@ familiar situation they don &apos;t know how to deal with they slow down .
for example , meas@@ les was four million of the dea@@ ths back as recently as 199@@ 0 and now is under 40@@ 0,000 .
and more recently you can see it &apos;s just around the equ@@ ator .
and that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map s@@ hr@@ in@@ king .
i can say that , even though i &apos;m a college dro@@ p-@@ out .
so , how do you make education better ?
you might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
and the whole spirit and at@@ titude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
and that allows us to understand who &apos;s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
the first embra@@ ce is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
i was to the point where i was using a stop@@ watch and painting squ@@ ar@@ es out of rand@@ om@@ ness , and i wasn &apos;t getting anywhere . so i went back and du@@ mp@@ ed all my pain@@ t@@ ings in the ar@@ no , and i thought , i &apos;m going to just start playing around .
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don &apos;t want to see this history disappe@@ ar . &quot;
how many of you are completely comfortable with calling y@@ ourselves a leader ?
&quot; and i felt so bad for this du@@ de that i took the l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop , and as soon as i did , you got this incredibly sever@@ e look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , &apos; look at that . look at that .
we need to get over it so we can move beyond it , and our little brothers and our little si@@ sters , and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other &apos;s lives more than money and power and ti@@ tles and influence .
so no@@ wa@@ days in the operating room , we no longer need to use sun@@ light .
so if you &apos;ve sent three spec@@ im@@ ens , it &apos;s an hour later .
the molecule pas@@ ses through and gets ex@@ cre@@ ted .
and then if that no@@ de has cancer , the woman would go on to get the ax@@ ill@@ ary ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ de dis@@ section .
in the setting of pro@@ state cancer , up to 60 percent of men after pro@@ state cancer surgery may have ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence and er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le dis@@ function .
so here &apos;s a tumor .
i &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
but electricity also will go in all direc@@ tions -- the path of least resi@@ stance , which is where that phr@@ ase , in part , comes from .
and because it &apos;s a protein , it &apos;s en@@ co@@ ded for in the dna of this organis@@ m .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new tar@@ gets for which drugs could be designed or scre@@ en@@ ed against , or maybe places where electro@@ des could be put in for people who have very sever@@ e dis@@ ability .
and the animal &apos;s going to hear a t@@ one -- and a flas@@ h of light occur@@ red there .
maybe 100,000 people have co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which allow them to hear .
and the goal , of course , of this ma@@ ze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that &apos;s under the li@@ t top port .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
and we also sam@@ pl@@ ed the out@@ door air .
thank you .
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
so it &apos;s been a very optimi@@ stic time , i think , and i want to just talk about a few of those things .
this is what they think about my site ; it &apos;s ran@@ ked by blog auth@@ ority .
so basically , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages is that person &apos;s google share of that term .
they &apos;re talking about sla@@ very in 18@@ 60 .
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
we are increasingly off@@ ered a diet in which sen@@ sation , not story , is king .
and the speed with which they associ@@ ate it with &quot; sl@@ um@@ dog milli@@ on@@ ai@@ re &quot; or the fa@@ vel@@ as in rio spea@@ ks to the en@@ during nature .
and the stories they held provi@@ ded a shared experience .
these films held what was too hur@@ t@@ ful to say out l@@ oud , and they became more useful to me than the wh@@ is@@ pers of survi@@ vor@@ s and the occasi@@ onal gli@@ mp@@ se of a tat@@ too on a ma@@ i@@ den a@@ unt &apos;s wr@@ ist .
can oper@@ a be ever@@ -@@ so-@@ slightly sex@@ y ? the gl@@ ori@@ ous sop@@ ran@@ o dan@@ i@@ elle de ni@@ ese shows how , sing@@ ing the fli@@ r@@ ty &quot; meine li@@ ppen , sie kü@@ ssen so hei@@ ss . &quot; which , transl@@ ated , means , as you might guess : &quot; i k@@ is@@ s so hot . &quot; from gi@@ u@@ di@@ tt@@ a by fr@@ ans le@@ h@@ á@@ r ; ac@@ compan@@ ist : ing@@ rid sur@@ gen@@ or .
commer@@ ce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundament@@ ally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
so we &apos;ve designed products and we analy@@ zed chemicals down to the parts per million .
the upp@@ er is n@@ yl@@ on 6 that can go back to ca@@ pro@@ l@@ ac@@ ta@@ m , the bottom , a pol@@ yo@@ le@@ ph@@ ine -- infin@@ itely recycl@@ able ther@@ m@@ op@@ la@@ stic .
when asked , they said , &quot; it &apos;s kind of like a giant toi@@ let that doesn &apos;t fl@@ ush . &quot;
and we have pl@@ ent@@ y of energy , so we &apos;ll solve that problem , but the biology problem &apos;s tri@@ cky , because as we put through all these tox@@ ic materials that we dis@@ gor@@ ge , we will never be able to re@@ cover that .
shoes for ni@@ ke , where the up@@ pers are pol@@ ye@@ sters , infin@@ itely recycl@@ able , the bot@@ tom@@ s are bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able sol@@ es .
because if they to@@ xi@@ fy themselves , being the lo@@ west@@ -@@ cost produ@@ cer , send it to the lo@@ west@@ -@@ cost distribution -- wal@@ -@@ m@@ art -- and then we send them all our money , what we &apos;ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mu@@ tu@@ ally assu@@ red destruction .
and then the com@@ post is all taken back to the roo@@ fs of the city , where we &apos;ve got far@@ ming , because what we &apos;ve done is li@@ f@@ ted up the city , the landscape , into the air to -- to re@@ store the na@@ tive landscape on the roo@@ fs of the buildings .
this is five times larger .
we didn &apos;t know about x@@ key@@ sc@@ ore . we didn &apos;t know about cyber@@ tr@@ ans .
yet we have these fil@@ es .
all right , how many swe@@ dis@@ h decisi@@ on@@ makers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u.@@ s@@ .@@ -@@ based services , like , you know , run windows or o@@ s@@ x , or use facebook or lin@@ ke@@ d@@ in , or store their data in clou@@ ds like ic@@ l@@ oud or sky@@ drive or dro@@ p@@ box , or maybe use online services like ama@@ zon web services or sal@@ es support ?
and who@@ ever tells you that they have nothing to hi@@ de simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
she was one of the tar@@ gets of n@@ sa sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce .
humans have long held a fascin@@ ation for the human brain .
and what you can see is it &apos;s very non-@@ uni@@ form . you see a lot more structure there .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
and in se@@ attle , we take these -- this is a whole human he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere -- and we put them into what &apos;s basically a gl@@ ori@@ fied meat sli@@ cer .
you can see on the microscop@@ e slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in real time .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
so if you &apos;re in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire li@@ sting of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug tar@@ gets and optimi@@ ze .
these aren &apos;t schizophren@@ ic individuals , but they do show some population vari@@ ation .
so why is that ?
the thing is , if we don &apos;t know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the medi@@ ev@@ al doctors and their le@@ e@@ ches .
&quot; if you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them .
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by ad@@ ding a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls for each imm@@ uni@@ zation .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to hand@@ ou@@ ts , it might destro@@ y markets to distribu@@ te free bed nets .
you know how to imm@@ uni@@ ze kids , you know how to give bed nets . &quot;
tell people the benefits of education , that &apos;s very cheap to do .
but look what we just did today .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .
we &apos;ve all heard these things .
and that has to do with me because in 199@@ 4 , i pac@@ ked a few things into a back@@ pack and head@@ ed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .
so let &apos;s start she@@ d@@ ding light on this amazing ec@@ lec@@ tic continent that has so much to offer .
so the very definition -- to say &quot; invest in africa &quot; is a no@@ -@@ go .
but looking at gold@@ man sa@@ chs &apos; work -- we had the famous bri@@ c report .
the announ@@ c@@ ement just came out the last few weeks .
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . pri@@ ces of goods go up , inf@@ lation is affected .
it &apos;s the 24@@ -@@ hour roll@@ ing african news chan@@ nel .
it also provi@@ des a third of the food we eat .
we so r@@ ar@@ ely look at the sky .
so this is the foot@@ age that i was showing everybody .
okay .
so this is the foot@@ age he photograph@@ ed , and it was pretty moving and pretty a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing .
it was , inci@@ dent@@ ally , the last time i ever saw da@@ y@@ light .
and he said , &quot; because no one knows you had anything to do with it . &quot;
how could somebody read using their finger@@ ti@@ ps ?
kt : no .
kb : just don &apos;t break my concent@@ ration .
i need two people to help me out real quick .
ok , now , do you believe in wit@@ ch@@ craft at all ?
kb : what did you feel ?
ok , now , allow it to stay there .
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
come right over here , next to me .
and i want you to rele@@ ase that negative energy by sha@@ king it from side to side .
you knew !
they &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don &apos;t do anything funny .
s@@ j : you &apos;re over a c@@ up .
do you think the spi@@ ke is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me .
you know that when you have those ab@@ u@@ sive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real tox@@ ic &quot; i want to kill myself &quot; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loo@@ p ta@@ pe , you might have yourself depression .
we are not equi@@ pped for the 21@@ st century .
we need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
but it was te@@ st@@ ably stupid .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot;
so to make the experiment , i knew i &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipu@@ late oxyto@@ cin directly .
so if i do something that hur@@ ts you , i feel that pain .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited .
the bri@@ de .
so there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
and you have people who gui@@ de those computers to do their c@@ ler@@ ical jobs .
one of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot;
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would improve their jobs .
i came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; we &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot;
kal@@ lik@@ upp@@ am had caught up with my control school in new del@@ hi , a rich private school with a trained biot@@ echn@@ ology teacher .
the re@@ p@@ tili@@ an part of our brain , which si@@ ts in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it shu@@ ts down everything else , it shu@@ ts down the pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex , the parts which learn , it shu@@ ts all of that down .
you can &apos;t catch me .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
it &apos;s a facili@@ ty which is prac@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
i &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; what &apos;s she doing ? ! what &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
if i pass out on the next song ...
this qu@@ and@@ ary led to the ti@@ tle of the project , which consi@@ ders in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent g@@ ho@@ sts of the past and the future .
and i found these maps which you see here .
so they &apos;re testing its vir@@ ul@@ ence .
everyone showed up .
ten@@ sions between these two families date back to 19@@ 13 when there was a dis@@ pu@@ te over local political power .
this is just an ab@@ ri@@ d@@ ged ren@@ der@@ ing of over a thousand images .
there &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- deta@@ ched from the instrument and from the stick , even though i &apos;m actually holding the stick quite ti@@ ghtly .
they &apos;re all different .
exactly . because i &apos;m not even tou@@ ching it .
in a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
however , not one of you got out of your se@@ ats to think , &quot; right ! how can i cla@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
and interest@@ ingly , the older i became , and when i became a ful@@ l-@@ time student at a so called &quot; music institution , &quot; all of that went out of the window .
in this so@@ aring demon@@ stration , dea@@ f per@@ c@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ev@@ el@@ yn gl@@ en@@ nie illu@@ str@@ ates how listening to music invol@@ ves much more than simply le@@ tting sound waves hit your ear@@ dru@@ ms .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a flo@@ at last year at the ma@@ cy &apos;s th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving day par@@ ade , and ri@@ ck ast@@ ley po@@ ps out , and ri@@ ck@@ roll@@ s millions of people on television .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
got a couple questions for you .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
and they were probably pleas@@ ed to see you on top of the time po@@ ll .
dinosau@@ r evolution proce@@ e@@ ded at a stat@@ ely p@@ ace , an order of magni@@ tude slo@@ wer on any way you want to measure it .
a three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half foot thing , beautiful sk@@ ul@@ l , predat@@ or , me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ater , a two-@@ leg@@ ged animal .
your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- your job as a leader is to try to inspi@@ re them to do more work than they &apos;ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can &apos;t imagine .
it turns out to have a fore@@ brain one-@@ fif@@ te@@ ent@@ h the size of a human .
somebody get the front legs .
and then work later is going to take us to ti@@ bet .
now we have diver@@ gen@@ ce over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
they &apos;re really kin@@ dre@@ d discipl@@ ines .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
you give her a quick cra@@ ck in the teeth with your el@@ bo@@ w and bla@@ ze for the finish line .
they &apos;re not doing 26 miles ; they &apos;re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and appar@@ ently without in@@ j@@ ury , without problems .
there &apos;s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradu@@ ally you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
you need a pack to pull together .
and what happened was we started creating these fan@@ cy c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes .
but maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
he &apos;s a sc@@ ary mon@@ ster .
you call your friend , she puts her hand@@ set in a robot , and , b@@ am ! you &apos;re a me@@ bot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gest@@ ure -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a brow@@ ser and jack into a little robot .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interven@@ tions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
but we can push this idea further .
robots touch something deeply human within us .
and i can &apos;t have my pos@@ se laugh@@ in &apos; at me .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i can master sho@@ ck of &quot; the cr@@ ying game &quot; with the a@@ we of a child being called an aids vic@@ tim by a bul@@ ly who didn &apos;t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &apos;s a double ent@@ end@@ re .
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a loo@@ k-@@ ali@@ ke of di@@ ana and posed her in the right posi@@ tions and an@@ gles and created something that was in , or exi@@ sted in , the public imagination .
well , here is the image .
so , all this work is getting shown in art g@@ aller@@ ies .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
what jack ni@@ chol@@ son might be up to in his cele@@ bri@@ ty life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road ra@@ ge and gol@@ f-@@ clu@@ b@@ bed a driver the other day .
has anyone here wonder@@ ed what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting ch@@ est pa@@ ins , shor@@ t@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ating ?
that is something to keep in mind . we can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this .
we have 25 posi@@ tions right now -- all of them trained , board cer@@ ti@@ fied in the usa , canada or britain .
and we will do other centers .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
we &apos;re also starting an@@ c@@ ill@@ ary heal@@ th-@@ care technology training programs -- training people in e@@ cho@@ car@@ di@@ ograph@@ y , car@@ di@@ a@@ c ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at home here , because there &apos;s a lot of autis@@ m gene@@ tics here .
my dra@@ wings got to star in the movie too .
and the way i sold li@@ ve@@ stock jobs is i showed off my dra@@ wings , i showed off pictures of things .
i was really concerned about having to wear this g@@ ad@@ get on my face .
i find a lot of people have diffic@@ ul@@ ty doing that .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a d@@ res@@ s@@ maker &apos;s shop se@@ wing clo@@ th@@ es .
because what i &apos;m obser@@ ving is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colle@@ ges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
what are you most passionate about ?
now my own speci@@ ality is combin@@ ing digital technology and magic .
b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ ye .
and it was deep . it was deep in my sou@@ l .
now there &apos;s a talent un@@ to itself .
and now the sh@@ ore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
thank you .
the first problem is there &apos;s in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate disaster response .
they send him to iraq .
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veter@@ ans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
what would this lead to ?
and so they invented the scientific journ@@ al as a way of syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
the progra@@ mm@@ ers come and go .
this has the following effect : a program@@ mer in e@@ din@@ burgh and a program@@ mer in ent@@ e@@ b@@ be can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software .
right .
it was the expec@@ tation of the citizens that she would not be cen@@ sor@@ ed .
this one i thought i &apos;d show you .
mor@@ gan hen@@ dry : be@@ ware of safety is an instru@@ mental rock band .
so we literally are all made out of star@@ d@@ ust .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen@@ y dark do@@ t .
okay , we have par@@ ach@@ ute al@@ ig@@ ned .
b@@ c : we enter the mar@@ ti@@ an atmosphere .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back sh@@ ell , and we &apos;re now in fre@@ e-@@ fall .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our c@@ ad / cam@@ s and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about ther@@ mal properties , know about design , know about atmosp@@ her@@ ic interaction , par@@ ach@@ utes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spac@@ ec@@ raft in a computer to some ex@@ tent , so to see , does that meet the requi@@ re@@ ment that we need .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cli@@ ff , we have a little las@@ er system which will actually za@@ p the rock , ev@@ apo@@ rate some of it , and actually analy@@ ze what &apos;s coming from that rock .
so as we fle@@ w by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
you just drive to the ne@@ ar@@ est la@@ ke , stick your ho@@ se in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
so if we start to think exponenti@@ ally , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &apos;s an ap@@ p for that .
you can t@@ we@@ et your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
how about aug@@ ment@@ ing the physi@@ cian ?
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic vo@@ y@@ age , &quot; the i@@ p@@ ill .
in genom@@ ics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we can be pre@@ vent@@ ative ; that pre@@ ven@@ tion can be person@@ alized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly partici@@ pat@@ ory .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of top@@ ics , particularly in car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular disease .
the first one is de@@ dic@@ ated to spen@@ cer , and his grandmother , who was sho@@ cked by his work .
in those days there was still coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side close to the city , far@@ ms , cor@@ n@@ fields , co@@ ws ; even not far from our building with its bl@@ ur@@ red bri@@ ck and long sha@@ dow@@ y hall@@ way you could find tra@@ cts with h@@ ills and trees you could pre@@ tend were mountains and fore@@ sts .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ly st@@ um@@ bling , fall@@ ing , spra@@ w@@ ling , sk@@ ir@@ t hi@@ ked , eyes v@@ ein@@ ed red , s@@ wollen with te@@ ars , her sh@@ ame , her dis@@ honor .
this is called &quot; thir@@ st . &quot;
a cas@@ ual impul@@ se , a fan@@ cy , never thought of until now , har@@ dly thought of even now ...
the girls , to my hor@@ ror , a@@ ver@@ ted their ga@@ ze .
c@@ .@@ k. willi@@ ams : poetry of you@@ th and age
sam@@ u@@ el p@@ is@@ ar , an au@@ schwi@@ tz survi@@ vor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st teach@@ es us that nature , even in its cru@@ el@@ est moments , is ben@@ ig@@ n in compar@@ ison with man , when he lo@@ ses his moral comp@@ ass and his reason . &quot;
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to re@@ mind us of the trage@@ dy of war .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our h@@ f radio anten@@ na .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it sol@@ o .
when the ice was flat or fl@@ at@@ tish , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach -@@ -@@ but it worked perfectly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sle@@ dge . did a sort of video di@@ ary piece .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn &apos;t get into trouble about the l@@ ength of my air@@ stri@@ p .
since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed -- this was 9@@ 3 years ago -- since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed from the coast of ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a to the pole and back .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
and i remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the lab wan@@ ting to make some easy c@@ ash and this was the guy .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
these were the fe@@ ars that dan@@ ced in the imag@@ in@@ ations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they cho@@ se to listen to would gover@@ n whether they lived or died .
what would happen to our minds ?
the no@@ ve@@ list v@@ la@@ di@@ mir n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v said that the best re@@ a@@ der has a combin@@ ation of two very different temper@@ am@@ ents , the arti@@ stic and the scientific .
i &apos;m 4@@ 3 years old right now .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and while this was the major difference between many initi@@ a@@ tives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was im@@ posed on us , and people re@@ je@@ cted that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
i remember one night when someone ph@@ oned me on my cell@@ phone -- ordinary person who i don &apos;t know -- from ta@@ hri@@ r square .
is this a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ year , a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ decade or something more ?
they &apos;ve had some speak@@ ers there .
and frank@@ ie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the need@@ le coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a need@@ le anymore than you want to share a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush even with someone you &apos;re sle@@ eping with .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is re@@ vie@@ wing the data -- end@@ less@@ ly re@@ vie@@ wing the data .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more part@@ ners than straight people on the party scene .
but it is changing the equ@@ ation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decisi@@ on-@@ making .
what does that mean ?
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the gl@@ ories of human existence .
and i &apos;d pull her out on the front por@@ ch .
it &apos;s called cla@@ w-@@ ham@@ mer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it sounds something like this .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of ac@@ r@@ es of c@@ ot@@ ton .
now , my mother hop@@ ed that we learned from that the value of hard work .
good news : ch@@ ari@@ ot &apos;s coming .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whit@@ ney .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der for them .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by ste@@ pping on this pe@@ d@@ al right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little ham@@ bone sol@@ o or something like this .
not only is there a relationship between the eth@@ ics of science and the eth@@ ics of being a citi@@ zen in democracy , but there has been , histor@@ ically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the co@@ smo@@ s is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
and mer@@ ging them together to make the final quant@@ um theory of space and time and gravity , is the cul@@ min@@ ation of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-@@ organization that suff@@ ice to explain all of us and everything we see .
in fact , i &apos;m finished . science will never go away .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so i looked for fur@@ ni@@ ture .
he can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8@@ ,000 people .
what came out of it ?
there is a ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn orche@@ str@@ a living inside the building .
these are some pictures vis@@ it@@ ors sent to me .
and the mon@@ keys in that mon@@ key forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &apos;s not experienced the same way the world over .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-@@ awareness .
but i see something pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly transforma@@ tive in experi@@ en@@ cing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
one of the -- thank you for invi@@ ting us .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from re@@ pl@@ ying to one of those e@@ mails from nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &quot; if there is anyone out there who still dou@@ b@@ ts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &quot;
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
what &apos;s interesting is the spi@@ ke on the back of the dra@@ cor@@ e@@ x was growing very fast as well .
and then , because the ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es are in my colle@@ ction , i cut them open and look inside .
here &apos;s another one .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders .
and it &apos;s a respon@@ sive system that &apos;s trained on actual weather .
anyway , moving along .
so , un@@ fol@@ ded it &apos;s about 300 lin@@ ear feet .
the view is den@@ i@@ ed in the g@@ aller@@ ies where we recei@@ ve just natural light , and then ex@@ posed again in the north g@@ aller@@ y with a pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic view .
wait a minute , it &apos;s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
and this is a mo@@ ck@@ up that is in s@@ alt la@@ ke city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in ful@@ l-@@ scale .
even in stories on gen@@ der@@ -@@ based violence , men get an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of print space and air@@ time .
what she found was many of these stories tend to bl@@ ame vic@@ ti@@ ms and de@@ value their lives .
putting them there made them more recogni@@ z@@ able .
she was the c@@ bs news cor@@ respon@@ dent who was bru@@ t@@ ally sex@@ ually as@@ sau@@ l@@ ted in eg@@ y@@ pt &apos;s ta@@ hri@@ r square right after this photo was taken .
the bot@@ an@@ ical names are in front of you .
&quot; be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
p@@ m : so is this a good idea .
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .
so being an american , i decided to set up a cau@@ c@@ us .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &apos;t just about foreign policy , but it &apos;s about bud@@ gets , military bud@@ gets , and how the deb@@ ts of countries work out .
so , yeah .
great news . it dri@@ ves me nu@@ ts that most people don &apos;t seem to know this news .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or la@@ tin america or model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &apos;t love a brazi@@ li@@ an model ? -- but look at sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
right now today , in o@@ sl@@ o as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their pay@@ ments to governments for extra@@ cting oil in developing countries .
by doing so , you will join us and coun@@ t@@ less others in what i truly believe is the greatest ad@@ vent@@ ure ever taken , the ever@@ -@@ dem@@ and@@ ing journey of equ@@ ality .
so now , if you take this metaphor &#91; of &#93; genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris ander@@ son is a computer@@ -@@ fabri@@ cated arti@@ fact , as is jim wat@@ son , cra@@ ig vent@@ er , as are all of us .
you &apos;re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high-@@ level language , you &apos;ll describe that cell phone .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of s@@ alt , we heat them up to almost bo@@ il@@ ing and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short str@@ ands b@@ ind the long str@@ ands and start to form structure .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami , a beautiful ren@@ di@@ tion of china , which even has ta@@ i@@ w@@ an , and you can see it &apos;s sort of on the world &apos;s shor@@ test le@@ ash , right ?
it was started by er@@ ik win@@ free , and what it does , it has ti@@ les that are a hundre@@ d@@ th the size of a dna origami .
and if you do that , the origami &apos;s the same size , but the resul@@ ting square that you get is three times bigger .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we &apos;ll make the kind of squ@@ ar@@ es that i described and maybe even get to some of those self-@@ assem@@ bled circu@@ its .
when life brought about a series of death and ne@@ ar-@@ death experiences within my close circle , which high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for an emergen@@ cy medical response service in india , similar to 9@@ 11 in usa .
yet , if you analy@@ ze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , &quot; h@@ mm , let me see who i can pay a bri@@ be to today . &quot;
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bri@@ bes every year , or equal to india &apos;s g@@ dp .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just gr@@ ant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
so the data that you &apos;ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comm@@ ents , all the vie@@ ws , who &apos;s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comm@@ ents .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what &apos;s one conversation is actually com@@ posed of many smaller ones .
well here &apos;s one by j@@ essi@@ ca green about the micro@@ bi@@ al ec@@ ology of buildings .
ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ ity mi@@ mi@@ cked by men who grew up with no fa@@ thers , cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage wor@@ n by bu@@ lli@@ es who are danger@@ ously ar@@ med but need hu@@ gs .
invest , invest , invest . &quot;
a wise person knows how to impro@@ v@@ ise , as lu@@ ke did when he re-@@ was@@ hed the floor .
all they had was mi@@ ke &apos;s hard le@@ mon@@ ade , which was five percent al@@ co@@ hol .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
don &apos;t get me wrong . we need rules !
all we ask is , &quot; what ser@@ ves my interests ? &quot;
be proud that you have them .
so there &apos;s a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebra@@ te .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast down@@ h@@ ill .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
they &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator . &quot;
it turned out , as i think you could see in ai@@ mee &apos;s cap@@ abilities and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adap@@ table .
i &apos;ll give you some a@@ sto@@ unding things that have happened as we started this .
he was le@@ an@@ ing on his other arm .
and i get a call and we go back to washington .
i said , &quot; what am i going to say ?
it is an easy answer .
it &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
the earth moved for both of them .
there was so many skep@@ tics , especially the press in london , that they started flying che@@ es@@ e@@ bur@@ gers on heli@@ cop@@ ters around my box to temp@@ t me .
so , i went to talk to a doctor friend , and i asked him how could i do that ?
and then there is sta@@ tic ap@@ ne@@ a .
he &apos;s six foot four . he &apos;s 1@@ 60 pounds .
this was a critical mistake .
and what he did in response , is he went on reg@@ is and kel@@ ly , and broke his old record .
which was making me more nervous .
it was awful .
i was like &quot; what ? &quot;
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bul@@ le@@ tin .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of process@@ ing to conver@@ t that image that we just took into a sort of digital finger@@ print , and the great thing is , if you &apos;re a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much iden@@ tical to what we &apos;ve just used to create this demon@@ stration .
for those of us in this room , it &apos;s not just the poor@@ est and the most vulnerable individual , it &apos;s the community , it &apos;s the culture , it &apos;s the world itself .
last week , bill clin@@ ton at the ted a@@ wards said , &quot; this situation is un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented , un@@ equal , un@@ fair and un@@ stable . &quot;
many of you , i think , have probably tre@@ k@@ ked here .
we &apos;ve seen the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of small@@ po@@ x .
it is something to be great@@ ly optimi@@ stic about .
and when they did , they took small@@ po@@ x to 10 other countries and rei@@ gni@@ ted the epidemic .
there isn &apos;t a dog on this earth that &apos;s a natural cre@@ ature .
well , they &apos;ve now taken that gene , that bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ cent gene , and put it into mam@@ mal cells .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in europe -- without any regu@@ lation , and even without any identi@@ fication on the pac@@ ka@@ ge .
and it rais@@ es the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species in the age of biot@@ echn@@ ology -- a question that we &apos;re not really sure yet how to solve .
we &apos;ve taken away the autonom@@ y of this animal . &quot;
this is a mouse created by charles vac@@ ant@@ i of the university of mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts .
we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet .
and he went on to say , &quot; these differences do not co@@ in@@ cide with cor@@ respon@@ ding differences in climate . &quot;
but u@@ v@@ b and u@@ va especially , came in un@@ im@@ pe@@ ded .
there was natural sele@@ ction for the evolution of ligh@@ tly pig@@ mented skin .
so we have , in skin pig@@ ment@@ ation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
you , you can teach it .
so let me show you a few objects .
to the right , i took a higher rou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess .
why so ? because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very ill@@ -@@ defined .
well , they do mix .
i played with it for a while , and i made it return to the orig@@ in .
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price vari@@ ation .
it &apos;s so un@@ interesting .
ben@@ o@@ it mand@@ el@@ brot : fra@@ ct@@ als and the art of rou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess
so , imagine that all of you are partici@@ pants in the study .
here &apos;s an example of the puzz@@ le you &apos;re going to solve .
so , you &apos;re putting in less ju@@ ice , and therefore the out@@ come : fewer puzz@@ les solved .
right ? a patient in the driver &apos;s seat , for example .
not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a sur@@ plus of food in the ferti@@ le regi@@ ons of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north , people could not access or enti@@ tle themselves to that food .
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial ac@@ tors ?
to give you an example , between 2001 and 200@@ 2 , ethi@@ op@@ ian ma@@ ize farmers produced two years of bu@@ mp@@ er harv@@ est .
in the american mid@@ west , farmers used to load grain onto bar@@ ges and send it u@@ pri@@ ver to the chicago market .
that means that the exchange will operate a tra@@ ding system , which will ini@@ tially start as an open out@@ c@@ ry , because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electr@@ onic tra@@ ding .
we believe that the sta@@ kes are high , but that the re@@ turns will be even greater .
it is always the same , never the same , end@@ less@@ ly fascinating .
that &apos;s a potential scen@@ ari@@ o if we fail to take this seriously .
it provi@@ des a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habit@@ able spaces inside of the sand dun@@ es .
then , a few years after@@ wards , using per@@ ma@@ cultural strategi@@ es , we green that part of the desert .
it &apos;s not only something that suppor@@ ts trees , but something that conne@@ cts people and countries together .
i paid to get it re@@ pa@@ i@@ red -- then it broke again .
if this idea is truly sound , then the impli@@ cations are significant .
he &apos;s bar@@ e@@ foot . he &apos;ll run back into his house , and he will cont@@ amin@@ ate his drin@@ king water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fe@@ cal particles that are on his fing@@ ers and feet .
we don &apos;t have a neu@@ tra@@ l word for it .
and you might think it &apos;s just good kar@@ ma to see these guys stir@@ ring sh@@ it , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was enga@@ ged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-@@ law &apos;s house .
it &apos;s the most off@@ -@@ track mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um development goal .
and that was what i did .
there are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it &apos;s really hard to con@@ j@@ ure up much of a sense of well-@@ being , because it just kee@@ ps getting worse .
and we tra@@ w@@ l , which means to take something the size of a tra@@ ctor tra@@ il@@ er tru@@ ck that wei@@ gh@@ s thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and dra@@ g it across the sea floor to sti@@ r up the bottom and catch the fish .
but since we ate all the o@@ y@@ sters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan@@ k@@ ton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plan@@ k@@ ton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ k@@ ton .
and then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
but there are these , what we call , positive feed@@ bac@@ ks , the sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ es among them that make the whole va@@ stly greater than the sum of the parts .
in this bra@@ cing talk , coral re@@ e@@ f ec@@ ologist jer@@ e@@ my j@@ ack@@ son la@@ ys out the sho@@ cking state of the ocean today : over@@ fis@@ hed , over@@ he@@ ated , pollu@@ ted , with indi@@ cat@@ ors that things will get much worse . ast@@ on@@ ishing photos and stat@@ s make the case .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
that this old man would inter@@ ru@@ pt his mo@@ on@@ light stro@@ ll with his s@@ wee@@ the@@ art with the pre@@ cise reason of making fun of a child .
i went with my friend tim mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al , who sat on my left .
the sand@@ wor@@ ms were fine , but your favorite character ?
does something seem strange about this to you ?
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .
she was s@@ mil@@ ing . she did not understand why i was so worried .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
jo@@ se@@ ph sch@@ um@@ peter called this &quot; the process of creative destruction . &quot;
is this really how econom@@ ies be@@ have ? &quot;
what is the obje@@ ctive ?
what does all this mean for economics ?
but it &apos;s also clear that pro@@ sper@@ ity goes beyond this .
i mean , can you picture a politi@@ cian standing up in britain and saying , &quot; g@@ dp fell two percent this year . good news !
i pain@@ ted it directly on top of the man .
i made the tough decision of going home after gradu@@ ation and not going up to capit@@ ol h@@ ill , but going down to my parents &apos; bas@@ ement and making it my job to learn how to paint .
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i couldn &apos;t have for@@ es@@ e@@ en that i would go from pur@@ su@@ ing my dream in politics and working at a des@@ k to tri@@ pping over a sha@@ dow and then turning people into pain@@ t@@ ings and painting on people in a pool of milk .
and it goes all the way over to these big , thi@@ ck , gal@@ um@@ ph@@ y ones that have hundreds of carb@@ ons , and they have thousands of hydro@@ gens , and they have van@@ a@@ dium and heavy met@@ als and su@@ l@@ fu@@ r and all kinds of cra@@ z@@ iness han@@ ging off the sides of them .
they set the pri@@ ces , and i don &apos;t even know .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
and we take it as , you know -- we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
in fact , it &apos;s continu@@ ed to increase .
this is 198@@ 8 -- we actually bom@@ bed two ir@@ ani@@ an oil plat@@ forms that year .
what you see in this top drawing is a sche@@ matic of how pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um gets used in the u.s. economy .
that &apos;s a lot .
we are running late .
now you &apos;d think that &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; would introdu@@ ce a measure of americ@@ ani@@ zation .
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
and to the right hand side of us was this great k@@ hum@@ b@@ u gl@@ aci@@ er .
we want you to walk up the h@@ ill in another two days &apos; time .
after he swa@@ m the north pole , le@@ wi@@ s pu@@ gh vo@@ wed never to take another col@@ d-@@ water di@@ p . then he heard of la@@ ke im@@ ja in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , created by recent gl@@ ac@@ ial mel@@ ting , and la@@ ke pu@@ mor@@ i , a body of water at an al@@ titude of 5@@ 300 m on ever@@ est -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swi@@ mming and think about climate change .
this is a state diagra@@ m . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
i thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer &apos;s version : can we build a mechan@@ ical system in in@@ organic materials that will do the same thing ?
and literally with only those two in@@ puts -- so , the shape of your boundar@@ y condition and the pressure -- you can define an infin@@ ite number of len@@ ses that cover the range of human re@@ fra@@ ctive er@@ ror , from min@@ us 12 to plus eight di@@ op@@ ters , up to four di@@ op@@ ters of cy@@ lin@@ der .
but they can show you how to build things in sequence .
you could just hang it as a bed she@@ et , but again , the compu@@ tation of all the physics gives you the a@@ ero@@ dynamic shape .
and the cor@@ relation , of course , is that den@@ ser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn &apos;t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
this is a ma@@ p@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transpor@@ tation .
which brings on another th@@ res@@ hold effect i like to call fur@@ n@@ ace du@@ mp@@ ing , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be he@@ ated with a fur@@ n@@ ace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
during the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century , we wit@@ n@@ essed the at@@ ro@@ cities of stal@@ in , hit@@ ler , ma@@ o , po@@ l po@@ t , r@@ wand@@ a and other geno@@ ci@@ des , and even though the tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ first century is only seven years old , we have already wit@@ n@@ essed an on@@ going geno@@ cide in dar@@ fu@@ r and the daily hor@@ r@@ ors of iraq .
according to non-@@ govern@@ mental organizations that keep such statistics , since 19@@ 45 , in europe and the americ@@ as , there has been a ste@@ ep dec@@ line in inter@@ state wars , in de@@ ad@@ ly eth@@ ni@@ c ri@@ ots or po@@ gro@@ ms , and in military cou@@ ps , even in south america . worldwide , there &apos;s been a ste@@ ep dec@@ line in dea@@ ths in inter@@ state wars . the yellow b@@ ars here show the number of dea@@ ths per war per year from 19@@ 50 to the present .
so that &apos;s a bit of a support for the le@@ vi@@ a@@ than theory .
in fact , it &apos;s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of pa@@ ved roads .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a con@@ dom .
and what is the definition then ? &quot; the definition ?
we have liber@@ ia . we have con@@ go .
you can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
but more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divi@@ ded .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
and we had an increase in income .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are cat@@ ching up .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infe@@ cted .
it &apos;s caused by fast process@@ ing of tox@@ ic cas@@ sa@@ va ro@@ ot in fam@@ ine situation .
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much .
next best thing to a video game .
you have them in h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er societies , but then through technologi@@ cal evolution , new forms of technology ar@@ ise that facili@@ tate or encoura@@ ge the playing of non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum games , invol@@ ving more people over larger terri@@ tory .
and i would say the non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic is only going to grow more inten@@ se over time because of technologi@@ cal trends , but more inten@@ se in a kind of negative way .
it &apos;s when people &apos;s fortun@@ es are cor@@ related .
i think it &apos;s the first step toward that . that &apos;s the long-term goal .
the g@@ 8 sum@@ mit pro@@ pos@@ es that the solution to africa &apos;s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something ak@@ in to the mar@@ shall plan .
but equ@@ ally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
well , since i &apos;m not seeing the hand , it appe@@ ars that what i &apos;m stat@@ ing is true .
well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many african countries , un@@ offi@@ cial opportunities to profit from corruption .
governments are not changing it . why ?
there were 5@@ 6 , and when our president wanted to am@@ end the const@@ it@@ ution and re@@ move term limit@@ s , he had to create 25 new distri@@ cts , and now there are 8@@ 1 .
doctor se@@ li@@ g@@ man , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
and the conclu@@ sion of that is that psychology and psychiat@@ ry , over the last 60 years , can actually cla@@ im that we can make mis@@ er@@ able people less mis@@ er@@ able .
i &apos;ve spent my life working on extremely mis@@ er@@ able people , and i &apos;ve asked the question , how do extremely mis@@ er@@ able people diff@@ er from the rest of you ?
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
when he wal@@ ks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time st@@ ops for him . and it st@@ ops ti@@ ll the clo@@ sing bell .
and meaning , in this view , consi@@ sts of -- very par@@ alle@@ l to eu@@ da@@ im@@ on@@ ia -- it consi@@ sts of knowing what your highest streng@@ ths are , and using them to bel@@ ong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life satis@@ fac@@ tion people have .
but they were empty .
these are cam@@ els moving across the ri@@ ft valley in africa , photograph@@ ed by chris john@@ s .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to k@@ yle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
a li@@ on having a late night s@@ n@@ ack -- notice he &apos;s got a broken to@@ oth .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .

david gri@@ ff@@ in : how photograph@@ y conne@@ cts us
so , if we use information that comes off of this spe@@ cular refle@@ ction , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gro@@ ss cont@@ ours of the face and the basic shape , and aug@@ ment it with information that puts in all of that skin po@@ re structure and fine wr@@ in@@ kl@@ es .
we can turn the volu@@ me up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
what i &apos;ve been doing from 14 to 17 was , i was assi@@ sting them colle@@ cting i@@ vor@@ y t@@ us@@ k , meat and whatever they were killing , po@@ ach@@ ing , hun@@ ting in the forest , bring it in the main city to get access to the market .
here we have sa@@ van@@ na gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ es , but through evolution we have this forest gi@@ ra@@ ffe that lives only in con@@ go .
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has g@@ uns .
and that was the language of the war .
and they can &apos;t do what they are doing .
and one day , we went for a meeting .
i op@@ pose it -- that they are now going to dis@@ se@@ ct it , until i do my report and then i see the ch@@ ie@@ f com@@ man@@ der .
see what the wars in r@@ wand@@ a .
building capac@@ i@@ ties for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa .
did you know that , in iraq and afghanistan , there were more private military contra@@ c@@ tors on the ground than there were u.s. military tro@@ ops ?
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
oh , after you stopped paying .
for fear of dis@@ agre@@ ement , we s@@ hr@@ ink from these questions .
some of the reasons for this are not really very contro@@ versi@@ al .
the ver@@ tical axis now is thousands of dollars in today &apos;s pri@@ ces .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
you have to choose either option a or option b .
and some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
everything except rand@@ om@@ ness . she did not believe in rand@@ om@@ ness .
and that &apos;s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning .
but , both of these sa@@ y@@ ings -- saving a fish from dro@@ w@@ ning , or saving a man from dro@@ w@@ ning -- to me they had to do with inten@@ tions .
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said , human rights in bur@@ ma .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is lu@@ ck ?
i was able to see that in a fir@@ sth@@ and way , when i went to beautiful d@@ ong village , in gui@@ z@@ ho@@ u , the poor@@ est pro@@ vin@@ ce of china .
i believe in speci@@ fi@@ cs , the speci@@ fi@@ cs of story , and the past , the speci@@ fi@@ cs of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sli@@ ced bread , no one wanted it .
right . i go to the del@@ i ; i &apos;m sick ; i need to buy some medicine .
who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a co@@ w . nobody .
they turned a chair from something the pur@@ ch@@ asing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .

am@@ ih@@ ot@@ or@@ not@@ .com -- everyday 25@@ 0,000 people go to this site , run by two volunte@@ ers , and i can tell you they are hard gra@@ ders , and they didn &apos;t get this way by adverti@@ sing a lot .
silk . put a product that does not need to be in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated section next to the milk in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated section .
in a world of too many op@@ tions and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignor@@ e the ordinary stuff . marketing gur@@ u se@@ th go@@ d@@ in sp@@ ells out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizar@@ re ideas are more successful than bor@@ ing ones .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in ca@@ ir@@ o .
most of the economic models are built around sc@@ ar@@ city and growth .
if we can make it through the next 150 years , i think that your great great grand@@ children will forget all about mal@@ th@@ us .
the problem is that these pu@@ ps need a stable platform of soli@@ d ice in order to nur@@ se from their mom@@ s .
we can &apos;t keep taking without expe@@ cting serious consequences as a result .
i didn &apos;t want them to be over@@ ly thre@@ at@@ ening or sc@@ ary .
here we see a female cra@@ w@@ ling out of the ocean under mo@@ on@@ light on the island of tr@@ ini@@ dad .
7@@ 2 percent of the population has such sc@@ ars , but most don &apos;t shed the ge@@ ar , things like lo@@ b@@ ster tra@@ ps and cra@@ b po@@ ts .
i worked in other parts of new ze@@ al@@ and as well , in beautiful , fra@@ gi@@ le , prote@@ cted areas like in fi@@ ord@@ land , where this sea pen col@@ ony was found .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble . it &apos;s a pro@@ of of our fail@@ ing to save them in the wild .
when i stood there in the gr@@ ass , it &apos;s hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this wa@@ ving gr@@ ass .
now in this reci@@ pe you also have the cost .
and once the soil gets dri@@ ed , you &apos;re in a dry seas@@ on -- you get cra@@ cks , oxygen goes in , fl@@ ames come out and the problem starts all over again .
but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
and this is after two years .
and look , there &apos;s now 1@@ 1.@@ 2 percent more clou@@ ds -- already , after three years .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully suppor@@ ted by the people , meaning that you also have to ad@@ just it to the local , cultural values .
all the sculp@@ tures move by mechan@@ ical means .
it sounds good , but i &apos;ll bet you know in your gut that it &apos;s not the whole truth , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and i wa@@ ited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
free@@ ways .
what i &apos;m trying to say is the major contribu@@ tion on carbon emissions are from the cars -- more than 50 percent -- so when we dep@@ end only on cars , it &apos;s ...
you should have always a structure of living and working together .
and we cannot have all the answers .
okay , now why then is this curious rel@@ u@@ c@@ tan@@ ce and curious ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty to consciousness ?
how could spiritu@@ ality move anything ?
and just as the j@@ ar full of water can go from liquid to soli@@ d depen@@ ding on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being un@@ conscious , depen@@ ding on the behavior of the molecules .
okay , the next fe@@ ature of consciousness , after this mar@@ vel@@ ous uni@@ fied conscious field , is that it fun@@ ctions caus@@ ally in our behavior .
it &apos;s only relative to conscious ag@@ ents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university .
i won &apos;t demon@@ strate pain behavior , but i can tell you i &apos;m not having any pa@@ ins right now .
but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as sever@@ e , which has the same orig@@ ins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur@@ gen@@ cy .
and human resources are like natural resources ; they &apos;re often bu@@ ried deep .
we must dis@@ en@@ thr@@ all ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t see the point .
he said , &quot; as a kid . &quot; he said , &quot; actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve been around for 3@@ 6 months , and this is it ? &quot;
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
he wrote this to his love , mau@@ d gon@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ il@@ ing the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
now what &apos;s interesting about that is ir@@ regular ver@@ bs between al@@ fre@@ d and ja@@ y-@@ z have become more regular .
so i think in the next decade , the sci@@ ences and the human@@ i@@ ties will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about man@@ kind .
and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20@@ s .
and she walked forward with such cal@@ m and such c@@ lar@@ ity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
but an@@ ger is like gas@@ ol@@ ine , and if you spra@@ y it around and somebody lights a match , you &apos;ve got an in@@ fer@@ no .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less human@@ e , but it &apos;s less effective than using metho@@ ds that connect people with people , that re@@ build .
it &apos;s flo@@ wn around the world .
do you mind if we do something completely different ?
you could say , well , it doesn &apos;t look very different from when he started .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the hori@@ zon ?
if you look down , you can &apos;t see your feet .
and thanks to the people of interface , i have become a re@@ co@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er .
thinking it through , i realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move t to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
we re@@ ck@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our goal : zero impact , zero foot@@ print .
i re@@ main trou@@ bled by the re@@ vis@@ ed ehrlich equ@@ ation , i equ@@ als p times a divi@@ ded by t@@ 2 .
because it told me , by god , one person got it .
while we ini@@ tially her@@ al@@ ded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that reg@@ ard .
and at heart , both re@@ forma@@ tions , i think were asking the questions : who &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to practice ?
today &apos;s professional theater community is defined , not only the sha@@ w and strat@@ ford festi@@ v@@ als , but by the cor@@ ner@@ stone theater of los angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the ba@@ hi@@ a , the ca@@ tho@@ lic , the musli@@ m , the je@@ wish , even the na@@ tive american and the gay and les@@ bi@@ an communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explor@@ ed the differences in their faith and found common@@ ality as an important first step toward cros@@ s-@@ community heal@@ ing .
we want to play you one more sele@@ ction .
and that &apos;s how i got out of high school .
at a re@@ ception in their cour@@ ty@@ ard , i noticed that they had a foun@@ tain because they think that the people who go to the museum deser@@ ve a foun@@ tain .
and so the next thing you &apos;ll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the h@@ ein@@ z company -- you &apos;ve heard of them ?
we have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we &apos;ve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tenden@@ cy to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .
that &apos;s our library with more hand@@ cra@@ f@@ ted fur@@ ni@@ ture .
he was dra@@ g@@ ging guys out of b@@ ars and saving those lives for the l@@ ord .
she said , &quot; well , i work for a company called he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ pac@@ k@@ ard . &quot;
and i want my music to be with you . &quot;
and that &apos;s the building , and that &apos;s the model , and on the right &apos;s a high-@@ tech green@@ house and in the middle &apos;s the medical technology building .
this is in a place called san francisco .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s very nice .
because mr. ross used to bring in your al@@ bu@@ ms when i was 16 years old in the po@@ tter@@ y class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sun@@ light . &quot;
it &apos;s really our first for@@ ay into this .
so it consi@@ sts of two parts , what we call an en@@ co@@ der and a trans@@ duc@@ er .
so let me show you , and i &apos;m going to start with the standard method first .
this man is supposed to represent a gener@@ ic human being , and all of the cir@@ cles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
this is like the ste@@ al@@ th bom@@ ber of the ocean .
this is the vi@@ bri@@ o fis@@ cher@@ i molecule .
they take that information inside , and they decide what tas@@ ks to carry out depen@@ ding on who &apos;s in the min@@ ority and who &apos;s in the majority of any given population .
we &apos;ve also done the same thing with the p@@ ink system .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
look at all the argu@@ ments we have these days over health care , over bon@@ uses and ba@@ il@@ ou@@ ts on wall street , over the gap between rich and poor , over aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive action and sam@@ e-@@ sex marriage .
actually , that was ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s answer too .
he was a very good gol@@ fer , but he had a dis@@ ability .
what &apos;s your name ?
is walking the course essential to the game ?
first , no real spor@@ ts fan would talk that way .
so let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the united states , and for that matter , around the world .
michael san@@ del : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is enti@@ t@@ led to make that choice .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , r@@ na inter@@ ference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental compon@@ ent of how cells work .
the therap@@ ies will be impro@@ ving faster than the rema@@ ining im@@ perfe@@ ctions in the therap@@ ies are cat@@ ching up with us .
secon@@ dly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mi@@ ce ?
we can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and i cla@@ im that the engineering approach is within range .
some of them are par@@ tially imple@@ mented already , the ones at the top .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with imm@@ une systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to pro@@ create .
there are species that have no aging -- hy@@ dr@@ a for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tis@@ su@@ es in fact that rely for their function on very long-@@ lived cells .
and although i want to thank the tal@@ ented people of our company fore@@ most for that -- and also there &apos;s a factor of lu@@ ck and ti@@ ming -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i &apos;m full of dou@@ bt .
so we should embra@@ ce our difference and a@@ im for challenge .
what happens when a city deci@@ des it &apos;s going to set other pri@@ ori@@ ties ?
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
and we take car cr@@ as@@ hes for gran@@ ted .
but , of course , we &apos;ve seen what that does .
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god for@@ bi@@ d , that they have to change their lifest@@ yle .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
well , we looked at the tissue under the microscop@@ e .
the first one that we see occur@@ s in the ancient rain@@ fore@@ sts of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil de@@ pos@@ its . this is ri@@ ver@@ s@@ lei@@ gh .
wild dogs did eat a few of the she@@ ep , but the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine got a bad ra@@ p .
they &apos;re related dist@@ antly to th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he &apos;d been at this hu@@ t .
it &apos;s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spo@@ ken . everything has been said .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabili@@ zing the mi@@ cr@@ o economy .
is it being direc@@ ted effectively ?
it was really hot . i was very hun@@ gry .
and now let me become less sen@@ ti@@ mental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contribu@@ ting produ@@ c@@ tively into the economy .
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my wor@@ ries today is that we have many foun@@ da@@ tions now .
our in@@ ability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; sit down . &quot;
aid cannot solve our problems , i &apos;m fir@@ m@@ ly convinced about that .
a lot has been said here about women , i don &apos;t need to repe@@ at it .
i &apos;m going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments .
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poor@@ ly understood to say the least .
you can &apos;t just sort of -- &quot; it &apos;s great we &apos;ve got this key@@ board . &quot;
really , consciousness is se@@ ated in the fron@@ tal lo@@ be .
c@@ l : at this point , i &apos;ll take a few moments .
so what we had them do was memor@@ ize this lo@@ wer@@ -@@ left sound ic@@ on , please .
so just to conclu@@ de , we &apos;ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we &apos;ll ask questions here , not answer them .
look , the world has changed from anal@@ o@@ g to digital .
a techni@@ cian will put the electro@@ des onto the sc@@ al@@ p using a conduc@@ tive gel or pa@@ ste and usually after a proce@@ d@@ ure of prepar@@ ing the sc@@ al@@ p by light ab@@ r@@ asi@@ on .
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; pull . &quot;
and once you &apos;ve trained up the dete@@ ctions , these thoughts can be as@@ sig@@ ned or ma@@ pped to any computing platform , app@@ lic@@ ation or device .
so i &apos;m going to brie@@ fly disc@@ uss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions under@@ way .
es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o talked a little bit about this .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood .
there &apos;s all these different interven@@ tions but they have different kinds of effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
in 19@@ 35 , there were 15@@ 0,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but dd@@ t and a massive public health effort managed to squ@@ el@@ ch it .
now , it turns out we only kill the female mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es .
here we have it running at high-@@ speed mode .
it &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then deli@@ vered to me .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with res@@ ins , experiment with poly@@ mers .
three com@@ post b@@ ins -- go through about 70 kil@@ os of ra@@ w vege@@ table waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic com@@ post .
very advanced , no air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing -- i love it .
that &apos;s zero food waste .
basically i &apos;m recor@@ ding one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chron@@ ologi@@ cally comp@@ il@@ ing these one-@@ second tiny sli@@ ces of my life into one single continu@@ ous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recor@@ ding that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
and we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit back@@ wards in time .
these are the di@@ stances of the tu@@ bes which make it walk that way .
it &apos;s a bin@@ ary step counter .
you can only do them one at a time .
i think philosop@@ hi@@ cally , that was one of the most important pa@@ pers that we &apos;ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
so the team developed new de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging software , where we could test each syn@@ thetic frag@@ ment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .
and we ad@@ ded three quot@@ ations , because with the first genome we were cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for not trying to say something more profound than just sig@@ ning the work .
or , more importantly , hiv , where the virus evol@@ ves so quickly the vac@@ cin@@ es that are made today can &apos;t keep up with those evolutionary changes .
so i read slowly .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexi@@ ble the kor@@ an is , at least in minds that are not fundament@@ ally in@@ flexi@@ ble .
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
and they do that by each year sending out the re@@ produ@@ c@@ tives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a ma@@ ting flight .
and it sta@@ ys that size until the queen dies and there &apos;s nobody to make more ants , when she &apos;s about 15 or 20 years old .
on one day , it &apos;ll all be here , and then the next day they &apos;ll move it over there , and then they &apos;ll move it back .
they somehow get into this reser@@ ve .
well it turns out that yes , the different tas@@ ks are inter@@ depen@@ dent .
so , the ants in the older col@@ ony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the yo@@ unger col@@ ony .
they &apos;ve gone out to do different tas@@ ks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest ent@@ r@@ ance determin@@ es , or influ@@ ences , each ant &apos;s decision about whether to go out , and which task to per@@ form .
but in a small col@@ ony , it &apos;s likely to meet fewer for@@ a@@ gers , just because there are fewer other for@@ a@@ gers there to meet .
but it &apos;s the greatest trans@@ fer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of man@@ kind .
yes , it &apos;s going to continue .
it &apos;s 1@@ 30 oc@@ tan@@ e fuel .
i don &apos;t have to worry about the bridge to where at my age .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell that &apos;s what happened ?
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
and number two , do not build a re@@ former on the ocean .
i don &apos;t understand why the media is focused on eastern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania .
bo@@ one , i really , really appreci@@ ate you coming here , eng@@ aging in this conversation .
&quot; the el@@ dor@@ a@@ do of the united states of america : the discovery of in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble gold min@@ es in california . &quot;
half of them deser@@ ted to go look for gold .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bow@@ l to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in an@@ nu@@ al re@@ venue .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power gener@@ ating sta@@ tions .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clo@@ g@@ ging up a light so@@ cket .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .
now , there &apos;s more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary lo@@ gic .
now , we have a ration@@ ale for that .
and if you ask what kind of situation is condu@@ ci@@ ve to people defin@@ ing people as ene@@ mi@@ es , it &apos;s a zer@@ o-@@ sum situation .
it &apos;s why social organization has grown from the h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er village to the ancient state , the em@@ pi@@ re , and now here we are in a glob@@ alized world .
i think politicians can help fo@@ ster non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum relationships , economic engagement is generally better than block@@ a@@ des and so on , in this reg@@ ard .
it &apos;s un@@ fortun@@ ate that they tend to be sel@@ ec@@ tively de@@ plo@@ yed .
what time of life had they started school ?
he ac@@ tively sou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion .
in sur@@ ve@@ ys of european and american ex@@ ecu@@ tives , fully 85 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issues or concern@@ s at work that they were afraid to raise .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the sil@@ ence .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
i made a radical hypo@@ thesis .
we have shown that there &apos;s little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mam@@ mary gl@@ and that actually respond to extra@@ cell@@ ular matri@@ x .
but here is a po@@ em from ye@@ ats . i &apos;ll just read you the last two lines .
it &apos;s been fantastic .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &apos;re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive re@@ vie@@ ws about himself . surprise , surprise .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the de@@ cep@@ tion@@ -@@ dete@@ ction liter@@ ature .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
those cold , hard w@@ inter@@ s , i love it .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my leg@@ acy , part of my personal record ?
though in all seri@@ ousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accep@@ ted the job , and then she almost ran away scre@@ aming .
but i do that all the time .
i go back to color all the time .
my mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit skep@@ tical about the whole alternative lifest@@ yle thing .
i went to per@@ forming arts high school , where i was an actor .
and so i had this t@@ .@@ v@@ . show .
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , ro@@ sie .
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
che@@ f : oh , you don &apos;t know ? let me tell you something .
fashion designer is@@ a@@ a@@ c mi@@ z@@ ra@@ hi sp@@ ins through a di@@ zz@@ ying ar@@ ray of inspi@@ ra@@ tions -- from &apos; 5@@ 0s pin@@ u@@ ps to a fle@@ eting gli@@ mp@@ se of a woman on the street who makes him sh@@ out &quot; stop the ca@@ b ! &quot; inside this ra@@ m@@ bling talk are real clu@@ es to living a happy , creative life .
and i was actually a po@@ tent force in spre@@ ading ideas across bor@@ ders , and i wit@@ n@@ essed the rise of islam@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m as distin@@ ct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influ@@ enced my co-@@ religi@@ oni@@ sts across the world .
what &apos;s actually happening is that what were previ@@ ously lo@@ c@@ alized par@@ o@@ chi@@ al@@ is@@ ms , individual or grou@@ p@@ ings of extre@@ mi@@ sts who were isol@@ ated from one another , have become inter@@ connected in a glob@@ alized way and have th@@ us become , or are becoming , main@@ stream .
and a social movement is com@@ pris@@ ed , in my view , it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of four main characteri@@ stics .
the second , i believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
not ex@@ clu@@ sive to these things , but in addition to them , is pro@@ pag@@ ating a genu@@ ine demand for democracy on the ground .
because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a leader or rul@@ er or dic@@ tat@@ or .
it isn &apos;t when the sh@@ in@@ y new tools show up that their uses start per@@ me@@ ating society .
the internet is the first medium in history that has na@@ tive support for groups and conversation at the same time .
the b@@ b@@ c got their first wind of the chinese qua@@ ke from twitter .
and finally the chinese cra@@ cked down .
all of that is over .
he had to issue a re@@ p@@ ly .
ok , this is mo@@ unt ever@@ est .
it was a national geographic expedi@@ tion , but it was organized by the explor@@ ers club .
there &apos;s no ice over it .
from here , it &apos;s about 1,@@ 500 feet up at a 3@@ 0-@@ degree angle to the sum@@ mit .
this is a view taken along the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge .
it &apos;s really cold ; it &apos;s 24@@ ,000 feet .
the survi@@ vor@@ s came in one by one .
after la@@ ying in the s@@ now that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
he &apos;s dying .
he was cri@@ tically ill , there were other cri@@ tically ill patients ; lu@@ ck@@ ily , we were able to get a heli@@ cop@@ ter in to res@@ cu@@ e these guys .
so ideas change states .
but a demo@@ graphic divi@@ den@@ d is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
and then i think the other point is that indi@@ ans today are far more comfortable with glob@@ alization .
it &apos;s certainly not like china .
what are those ideas ? one is , i think , are ide@@ ological issues .
we can use technology for transpar@@ ency , and many other things .
if we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a ca@@ p on our carbon emis@@ sion , we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like india .
and this is a rain@@ y ele@@ ction day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and you have the market revolution of the 198@@ 0s and the huge increase of ine@@ quality in societies .
you have facebook revol@@ u@@ tions , twitter revol@@ u@@ tions .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the govern@@ mental decisions , discus@@ sions of the coun@@ cil of mini@@ sters , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the coun@@ cil discus@@ sions took place .
the idea is called the social impact bon@@ d .
the service provi@@ ders , well , for the first time , they &apos;ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they &apos;re doing in a really con@@ struc@@ tive way and learn and demon@@ strate the value of what they &apos;re doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment .
it en@@ ables testing of new ideas in a way that &apos;s less difficult for everybody .
&quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot;
he goes , &quot; sir , why don &apos;t you drive ? &quot;
why is that ? are you too ti@@ red to go all the way around ?
i &apos;m not supposed to be , like , walking down the a@@ is@@ le , and be like , &quot; hi , jack . &quot; you know , that &apos;s not cool .
was@@ su@@ p .
ted@@ x .
decided to use recycl@@ ed content from c@@ ement and steel manufacturing .
we must change everything .
it is transpar@@ ent , made just for you .
they were missing the vision .
so once those pictures are ac@@ qui@@ red and the physi@@ cian has dra@@ wn all the necessary safety limit@@ s and so on , he sel@@ ec@@ ts basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cur@@ sor is -- and he pres@@ ses this blue butt@@ on called &quot; son@@ ic@@ ate . &quot;
john is one of &#91; about &#93; a do@@ zen very hero@@ ic , coura@@ ge@@ ous people who volunte@@ ered for the study .
he &apos;s a 7@@ 8 year-old farmer who suff@@ ered from -- how should i say it ? -- it &apos;s called pain in the bu@@ tt .
i don &apos;t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
so new life was born .
all they have , really , is tra@@ de@@ mark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any gar@@ ment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
now , fashion designers have the broad@@ est pal@@ ette imag@@ in@@ able in this creative industry .
one that a lot of cultural cri@@ tics have poin@@ ted to is that we now have a much bro@@ a@@ der pal@@ ette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before , and this is main@@ ly because of the fast fashion industry , actually .
i love these gal@@ li@@ an@@ os .
if you look at the regi@@ stry , actually , a lot of the regi@@ ster@@ ed things in the e@@ .@@ u .
fire@@ works dis@@ plays , the smell of per@@ fu@@ me : no .
it is bar@@ ely te@@ ther@@ ed to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
i &apos;d been travel@@ ing in japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then i heard about this tree that is 2,@@ 1@@ 80 years old and knew that i had to go visit it .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fun@@ gu@@ s is actually inv@@ ading this tree .
but i put that slide in there because i &apos;m often asked if there are any animals in the project .
and what looks like two big he@@ ap@@ s of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get sh@@ red@@ ded up by the har@@ sh desert conditions over time .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planet@@ ary bi@@ ologists hop@@ ing to find clu@@ es to life on other planets by looking at one of the har@@ sh@@ est conditions on ours .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any brow@@ ser .
i think po@@ p@@ cor@@ n could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
consider the 2008 terror@@ ist attack on mu@@ m@@ bai .
is he bald in front ? does he wear glas@@ ses ? &quot;
you could ro@@ b 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too .
and to ha@@ ck@@ ers , dna is just another operating system waiting to be ha@@ cked .
that &apos;s what i get asked all the time .
the threat is serious , and the time to pre@@ p@@ are for it is now .
will i be mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized ?
and when we think about leg@@ acy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipu@@ lations than young men .
i know it works .
who gets to use the mo@@ squ@@ e on fri@@ days ? &quot;
and we placed him in a company in western kenya , just 200 miles away .
so , what do you think ?
and la@@ stly , the only portra@@ it of a male that leon@@ ardo pain@@ ted , &quot; the musi@@ cian . &quot;
ladies and gentle@@ men , this story has not yet been published .
i don &apos;t know why . i did not ask for a con@@ dom .
then i used , tried to use the medical college girls .
what if one decided to start phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y from the day one ?
do your job simply , the girl will ch@@ ase you .
every ho@@ li@@ day i had as a young boy was in a national park .
the pas@@ sen@@ gers who fell off the ti@@ tan@@ ic fell into water of just five degrees centi@@ grade .
i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the . i was gas@@ ping for air .
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big ch@@ un@@ ks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
l@@ p : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
the talk will be broad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
and so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood .
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate .
it &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ li@@ on wind@@ mil@@ ls .
that &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
and i said , &quot; i have no training as a doctor . i never cla@@ im@@ ed that . &quot;
and then she made me go up with the ta@@ pe of it and prove that george ab@@ bot@@ t actually could talk .
and , inci@@ dent@@ ally , i call her the ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ v@@ elt of the right .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot;
his father was an so@@ b , and , in fact , he was another com@@ edi@@ an with an un@@ happy childhood , but then we were off and running .
an amazing woman .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been off@@ ered to her , was her life .
the problem is , without techni@@ cians , without sp@@ are parts , don@@ ations like this very quickly turn into jun@@ k .
michael free at path says you have to figure out who will &quot; choose , use and pay the du@@ es &quot; for a product like this .
you &apos;ve got to sh@@ ine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover .
they &apos;re in@@ expensive , really ru@@ g@@ ged .
last story here : i &apos;ve got a friend in india who told me that you haven &apos;t really te@@ sted a piece of electr@@ onic technology for distribution in asia until you &apos;ve trained a cock@@ ro@@ ach to clim@@ b in and pe@@ e on every single little compon@@ ent on the inside .
one is the large global economy , the large glob@@ alized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to gover@@ n , to shape , this economy .
we are not talking about 5@@ 0,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
well , thank you . i mean , it &apos;s interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies .
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bri@@ be a civil ser@@ v@@ ant , but you are allowed to bri@@ be a de@@ pu@@ ty .
i &apos;m not conne@@ cting to them .
so i now have this sort of restaurant men@@ u vis@@ iting of art g@@ aller@@ ies .
and i thought , no , it &apos;s a very inti@@ mate look , but it &apos;s not a look a daughter gives her father .
am@@ on@@ gst them a yellow co@@ at with white fu@@ r , a yellow and black bo@@ di@@ ce , and you see these clo@@ th@@ es on lots of other pain@@ t@@ ings , different women in the pain@@ t@@ ings , ver@@ meer &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings .
not the pain@@ ter , i don &apos;t want to think about the pain@@ ter .
i kept thinking of be@@ ds and red che@@ e@@ ks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he &apos;s thinking about ?
but it is difficult to hear the words al@@ oud .
there was hollywood .
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of n@@ ollywood , i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these pre@@ conc@@ ei@@ ved no@@ tions .
we &apos;re not doing films for the eli@@ te and the people in their glass houses .
it &apos;s all about the foreign movies .
move it .
the nigeri@@ an film@@ makers really , really , are doing what they like .
difficult , e@@ h ? it &apos;s meaning@@ less .
and we know that there are more .
z@@ ambi@@ a-@@ born film@@ maker fran@@ co sac@@ ch@@ i t@@ ours us through n@@ ollywood , nigeria &apos;s bo@@ om@@ ing film industry . gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ a film@@ making and brilli@@ ance under pressure from cre@@ ws that can sho@@ ot a ful@@ l-@@ l@@ ength fe@@ ature in a week .
we were talking about the ra@@ p@@ ture ? it &apos;s coming .
you know , we have to go through that .
it &apos;s about roll@@ ing a ball and pi@@ cking up as many objects as you can in a fin@@ ite amount of time and hopefully you &apos;ll be able to make it into a planet .
so we have port@@ al because you sho@@ ot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , and then , most important , behavior .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a mani@@ fest@@ ation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
i did this building in japan .
we made the dra@@ wings of the fish and the sc@@ ales .
he was a sou@@ ven@@ ir sal@@ es@@ man who always wanted to be a pain@@ ter , and i was frank@@ ie p@@ . tor@@ onto .
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together .
and her@@ man mil@@ ler has this philosoph@@ y of having a place -- a people place .
and so then he put two bri@@ d@@ ges -- this all happened on the fa@@ x , going back and forth over a couple of weeks &apos; period .
they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is .
we used it at lo@@ yo@@ la on the cha@@ pel , and it didn &apos;t work .
this is a piece of property in br@@ ent@@ wood .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
and you &apos;re looking at it from the off@@ ices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
and i tried to -- there &apos;s a ni@@ ck gri@@ m@@ sha@@ w building over here , there &apos;s an ol@@ den@@ bur@@ g sculp@@ ture over here -- i tried to make a relationship ur@@ b@@ ani@@ sti@@ cally .
the ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cian in the competition gave us cri@@ teri@@ a , which led to this com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized sche@@ me , which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
and this is a tea@@ po@@ t i designed for al@@ ess@@ i .
it didn &apos;t work .
and so this is what they do .
so you start with the bag@@ asse , and then you take a very simple kil@@ n that you can make out of a waste fif@@ ty five-@@ gall@@ on oil dr@@ um .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stron@@ ger bri@@ qu@@ ette so that we could compe@@ te with wood char@@ coal in the markets in haiti .
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
and this bone is pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed , as you can see , with the light sh@@ ining through the sk@@ ul@@ l with ca@@ vi@@ ties , the sin@@ uses , which warm and mo@@ i@@ sten the air we brea@@ the .
as you can see , it &apos;s blo@@ cking her vision .
that &apos;s exactly what people used to say to sue .
he main@@ tain@@ ed a cal@@ m in@@ sou@@ ci@@ ance .
because you might say , &quot; well , this type of surgery might be re@@ gar@@ ded as co@@ s@@ me@@ tic . &quot;
and beauty doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to goo@@ dness , and certainly doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to cont@@ ent@@ ment .
&quot; i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . &quot;
so the better news is the future &apos;s almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering .
how do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
se@@ vent@@ y percent of all antibio@@ tics consum@@ ed in america is consum@@ ed in animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
it is about what we feed them .
why can we have 2@@ 9@@ -@@ cent big gul@@ ps and 9@@ 9@@ -@@ cent double bur@@ gers ?
we really need to change this whole paradig@@ m with kids and food .
they do ta@@ st@@ ings of these ingre@@ di@@ ents in the gar@@ den@@ ing clas@@ ses .
one of the things i do a lot is publi@@ c@@ -@@ private partner@@ ships .
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now .
so we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , ok , on lunch .
and he poin@@ ted up to the sky , and he said , &quot; look , do you see that ?
when i go to a philosop@@ her &apos;s party and they ask me what i work on and i say , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos;t gla@@ ze over -- their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a s@@ nar@@ l .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dis@@ satis@@ fied and incre@@ dul@@ ous when i attemp@@ t to explain consciousness .
i &apos;m working with a young computer@@ -@@ anima@@ tor docum@@ ent@@ arian named ni@@ ck de@@ am@@ er , and this is a little dem@@ o that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
and i started across the hall in north car@@ ol@@ ina , because i thought it was probably a can@@ al@@ et@@ to , and would have all that in detail .
how many of you did it by ro@@ tat@@ ing the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it mat@@ ched up with the one on the right ?
if you &apos;re seeing it as a cu@@ be flo@@ ating in front of some cir@@ cles , some black cir@@ cles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
and keep going , until the subject pres@@ ses the butt@@ on , saying , &quot; i see the change . &quot;
thanks very much for your attention .
they &apos;re basically attemp@@ ts at fig@@ uring out what people should do instead of rus@@ h hour car driving .
because you still have 80 percent of the traffic .
se@@ vent@@ y percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .
jon@@ as eli@@ as@@ son : how to solve traffic j@@ ams
what do we know about the country and the people that we pre@@ tend to protect , about the villa@@ ges where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is op@@ ium ?
you , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads no@@ d@@ ding , people who say , &quot; yes , i know exactly what you mean . &quot;
well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that hol@@ ds us back is access to information .
the question was , where from ?
where does medical ability end and start ?
it &apos;s really serious .
don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
there &apos;s a guy on twitter that i know , a health it guy outside boston , and he wrote the e-@@ patient ra@@ p .
and she saw that if there is no in@@ fl@@ am@@ ma@@ tion then the scan is a uni@@ form gra@@ y .
da@@ ve de@@ bron@@ k@@ art : meet e-@@ patient da@@ ve
and this , in terms of mag@@ nes@@ ium and the amount of water that i just mentioned , equ@@ ates to a $ 4@@ .@@ 5 billion min@@ ing industry for sing@@ apo@@ re -- a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
but one other extremely unique thing about bat@@ s is that they are able to use sound to percei@@ ve their environment . they use ech@@ olo@@ cation .
this is considered the five bl@@ ess@@ ings .
just have a quick look . and what we need to realize is that every 300 base pa@@ irs in your dna , you &apos;re a little bit different .
in europe alone , by 20@@ 50 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 1@@ 70 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
em@@ ma te@@ el@@ ing : the secret of the bat genome
europe had to be dra@@ g@@ ged into economic development .
the opportunity we &apos;re going to look to is a genu@@ ine basis for optimis@@ m about the bottom billion , and that is the com@@ modi@@ ty bo@@ oms .
that is not a for@@ ec@@ ast about how com@@ modi@@ ty pri@@ ces go ; it &apos;s a for@@ ec@@ ast of the consequences , the long-term consequences , for growth of an increase in pri@@ ces .
it turns out that elec@@ tor@@ al competition is the thing that &apos;s doing the damage with democracy , whereas strong che@@ cks and bal@@ an@@ ces make resource bo@@ oms good .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
paul colli@@ er : the &quot; bottom billion &quot;
all right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; he &apos;s a born surge@@ on . &quot;
so i was inspired by a friend .
so i &apos;m passionate about teaching these fl@@ s skills all over the world .
and we currently have access to el@@ even language pa@@ irs .
we need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place .
i continu@@ ed studying craft tradi@@ tions and collabor@@ ating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in li@@ th@@ u@@ ania with l@@ ace makers .
my life was not going to be the same .
my arti@@ stic hori@@ z@@ ons continue to grow .
it was 23 me@@ tri@@ c tons for one li@@ ter .
you could be attac@@ ked by white blood cells in the ar@@ ter@@ ies .
they &apos;re learning to fle@@ x this system that rele@@ ases their own en@@ do@@ gen@@ ous op@@ i@@ ates .
values are a certain kind of fact .
so the contribu@@ tions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
well , consider by analog@@ y , the concept of physical health .
the fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about geno@@ cide or nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or poverty or any other hu@@ gely con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al issue .
whenever we are talking about facts certain opini@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
sam har@@ r@@ is : yeah , well i think i tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock ti@@ cking , but the question is : what is volun@@ t@@ ary in a context where men have certain expec@@ tations , and you &apos;re guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ eil yourself ?
sam har@@ r@@ is : science can answer moral questions
here is a p@@ est , de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing p@@ est , a spi@@ der mi@@ te , because it does a lot of web@@ bing like a spi@@ der .
only the eg@@ g of the par@@ asi@@ te will be in@@ ser@@ ted into the body flu@@ ids of the ap@@ hi@@ d .
everything is just fine under these circum@@ stances .
and there goes the question , especially if you ask gro@@ wers , agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ri@@ sts : why biological control ?
step by step , it does nar@@ row .
automo@@ tive retro@@ fu@@ tur@@ ism is one of my speci@@ al@@ ties .
this is t@@ ank pol@@ o in the south ham@@ p@@ tons .
people wrote in for re@@ prin@@ ts of that thing .
it was perfectly clear . i didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
the third thing on my che@@ ck@@ list is rela@@ tions with neighbor@@ ing friend@@ ly societies that may pro@@ p up a society . and if that friend@@ ly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . in the case of the green@@ land nor@@ se , they had trade with the mother country -- nor@@ way -- and that trade d@@ wind@@ led : par@@ tly because nor@@ way got we@@ ak@@ er , par@@ tly because of sea ice between green@@ land and nor@@ way .
so , some societies , for sub@@ tle environmental reasons , are more fra@@ gi@@ le than others . and then finally , another gener@@ alization . i &apos;m now teaching a course at u@@ cl@@ a , to u@@ cl@@ a under@@ gradu@@ ates , on these collap@@ ses of societies . what really bu@@ gs my u@@ cl@@ a under@@ graduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
instead , all the major thre@@ ats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &apos;s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
what are you eating ?
how are we going to feed this world ?
this has happened in the ne@@ ther@@ lands in the 199@@ 0s during the classi@@ cal s@@ wine fe@@ ver out@@ break .
one kil@@ ogra@@ m of gras@@ sh@@ op@@ pers has the same amount of cal@@ ories as 10 hot dogs , or six big ma@@ cs .
so why are we not eating insects yet ?
look at them first . look at them first .
that means we get our new hi@@ ps for free .
in fact , when we &apos;re travel@@ ing ab@@ road , it &apos;s how we identify fellow can@@ adi@@ ans .
i dra@@ ped them cas@@ ually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
it was the world &apos;s first popular computer .
this is an astro@@ lab@@ e . pretty impres@@ sive , isn &apos;t it ?
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
it can be used for calcul@@ ating mathematical equ@@ ations of all different types .
but what we lose , i think , is an accu@@ rate -- a felt sense of the sky , a sense of context .
you &apos;re using your buil@@ t-@@ in dynam@@ ics , the physics of your body , just like a pen@@ dul@@ um .
let me demon@@ strate how it works .
and they already had a six leg@@ ged robot called le@@ mu@@ r .
instead of using electrical mot@@ ors , electro@@ mechan@@ ical actu@@ ators , we &apos;re using com@@ pres@@ sed air .
for those who probably know , if you don &apos;t have any sensor@@ s and there are any dist@@ urban@@ ces , you know what happens .
what you see over here , this is the beautiful lou@@ is v@@ u@@ it@@ ton c@@ up tro@@ ph@@ y .
and they assem@@ ble , and they form these kinds of mechanis@@ ms .
there was a great ted moment , i think it was sir ken ro@@ bin@@ son , was it ?
it &apos;s a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .
the biggest emplo@@ yer is the pur@@ due chicken process@@ ing plant .
specifically , we use these six design direc@@ tives , probably the most important being number two : we design with , not for -- in that , when we &apos;re doing human@@ it@@ ari@@ an-@@ focused design , it &apos;s not about designing for cli@@ ents anymore .
it &apos;s the physical construction of impro@@ ved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students .
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the in@@ cen@@ tive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in insi@@ de-@@ the-@@ box education systems in rural communities .
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from going out and doing eth@@ no@@ graphic research and doing the nee@@ d-@@ finding , coming back into the studio , doing the bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming and design visu@@ alization to come up with concep@@ ts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototyp@@ ing them , fig@@ uring out if they are going to work and re@@ fin@@ ing that .
but we feel like this could work in other places .
generally , what you see in green is not deser@@ ti@@ fying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth .
now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynam@@ ite , frank@@ ly .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry seas@@ on .
but we bi@@ ologists and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ sts had never tac@@ kl@@ ed anything as complex as this .
they put 2@@ 5,000 she@@ ep in one flo@@ ck , really mi@@ mi@@ cking nature now with plan@@ ned gra@@ zing , and they have docum@@ ented a 5@@ 0-@@ percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ as : well , thank you . thank you . thank you , chris .
and these two mis@@ sions , as you can tell , thre@@ ad together perfectly . one ad@@ ds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
after treatment , the child ga@@ ins significant func@@ tion@@ ality .
if you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are un@@ able to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over@@ -@@ frag@@ mented ; it &apos;s made up of a col@@ lage , a pat@@ ch@@ work , of regi@@ ons of different colors and l@@ umin@@ an@@ ces .
ps : and we see this pattern over and over again .
how does that happen ? we want dy@@ lan to be able to do that , and using this man@@ tra of motion , dy@@ lan actually can do that .
s@@ her@@ y@@ l sha@@ de : hi , ai@@ mee . ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s : hi .
dan o &apos;@@ bri@@ en jum@@ ped 5 &apos; 11 &quot; in &apos; 9@@ 6 in atlan@@ ta , i mean , if it just gives you a compar@@ ison of -- these are truly ac@@ compli@@ shed ath@@ le@@ tes , without quali@@ fying that word &quot; ath@@ le@@ te . &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can .
it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
i &apos;m like , &quot; get it off ! don &apos;t worry about it , you know .
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at , they were everywhere . you know , it &apos;s like a big -- it &apos;s come full circle .
and she came into town and she rus@@ hed around and she said , &quot; i have to buy some new shoes ! &quot;
now this is obviously a powerful , some might say danger@@ ously powerful , insi@@ ght .
some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large , but copy@@ right mathemati@@ cians who are media lo@@ bby experts are mer@@ ely surprised that it doesn &apos;t get com@@ po@@ unded for inf@@ lation every year .
see , in the real world math isn &apos;t necessarily done by mathemati@@ cians .
once you &apos;ve done that , then there &apos;s the compu@@ tation step .
i esti@@ ma@@ ted that , just today , across the world , we spent about 10@@ 6 average world life@@ times teaching people how to calcu@@ late by hand .
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; bas@@ ics ? &quot;
i don &apos;t think so .
but there &apos;s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
and of course , it turns into a circle .
and you know if you walk across a ch@@ as@@ m , you end up making it worse than if you didn &apos;t start at all -- bigger disaster .
its le@@ ash had been ti@@ ed to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just per@@ si@@ stent in her eff@@ or@@ ts to gre@@ et me , perhaps get a scrat@@ ch behind the ear .
these out@@ si@@ ghts ran@@ ged from the tri@@ val to the profound , from the m@@ und@@ an@@ e to the hu@@ mor@@ ous .
but it &apos;s all good in the grand sche@@ me of things .
everybody &apos;s wel@@ come .
and i see my life as a series of experiments .
as i say in my book , i &apos;m je@@ wish in the same way the o@@ live garden is itali@@ an .
so , certainly the challenge was there .
so , i was able to stone one adul@@ ter@@ er .
but this one is -- the bi@@ ble says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a men@@ stru@@ ating woman has sat .
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h , because i am a wor@@ ka@@ ho@@ lic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just ritu@@ als that give us meaning . &quot;
so , anyway , thank you so much for le@@ tting me speak .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot; or a single , simple phr@@ ase : &quot; real world geome@@ try . &quot;
but if you dis@@ played that on a cr@@ t or flat pan@@ el display , it would be meaning@@ less to hold up an arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary object , a real world object in that .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spa@@ tial operating environment , we call it .
there &apos;re a lot of elements .
so collabor@@ ative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-@@ lo@@ cated or dist@@ ant and distin@@ ct , is always important .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corpo@@ ra@@ tions and movie produ@@ cers ?
john under@@ ko@@ ff@@ ler : poin@@ ting to the future of u@@ i
what o@@ kol@@ lo@@ h did would not have been possible without human gener@@ osity .
someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
but the group of da@@ y@@ care centers repres@@ ented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bar@@ gain as of right now .
here is the critical difference between these : l@@ ol@@ cat@@ s is commun@@ al value .
and may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
or you could play many games in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
england invented 20 over@@ s cri@@ cket , and said , &quot; the world must play 20 over@@ s cri@@ cket . &quot;
six weeks , city versus city .
but what they were very good at doing was making it very lo@@ c@@ alized .
we started getting song and dance in indian cri@@ cket .
sh@@ an@@ e war@@ ne sold for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars .
can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no del@@ hi bel@@ ly in there anymore .
there are two kinds of er@@ r@@ ors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are er@@ r@@ ors in esti@@ ma@@ ting the od@@ ds that they &apos;re going to succe@@ ed , and er@@ r@@ ors in esti@@ ma@@ ting the value of their own success .
now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all , two things are va@@ stly over@@ -@@ esti@@ ma@@ ted , nam@@ ely tor@@ na@@ does and fire@@ works .
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot;
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 6@@ 0@@ k , then 50@@ k , then 40@@ k , a job where you &apos;re getting a sal@@ ary cut each year , and one in which you &apos;re getting a sal@@ ary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they &apos;re all told they make much less money . why ?
along the way , you lost something .
for some of the subje@@ cts , sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of go@@ di@@ va cho@@ col@@ ates , and for others is a can of sp@@ am .
if you &apos;re an american , for example , you &apos;ve probably travel@@ ed in fr@@ ance .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of per@@ cents in order to del@@ ay gra@@ ti@@ fication and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later : the b@@ ars on this side are higher than the b@@ ars on this side .
sur@@ ely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and for@@ give me , but in ra@@ w numbers these are very tiny acci@@ dents .
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
so , you know , when a school bus is blo@@ wn up and we &apos;ve never seen this before , our general tenden@@ cy is to ori@@ ent towards that which is new and novel is activ@@ ated .
ad@@ g : in per@@ su@@ ading them .
he appar@@ ently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profi@@ le .
so , it was going no@@ where .
this one gener@@ ates no ima@@ gery at all . &quot;
that can be a big contribu@@ tion .
the phr@@ ase &apos; art is whatever &apos; expres@@ ses the current inclu@@ si@@ ven@@ ess that surro@@ unds ar@@ t-@@ making -- a sort of &apos; it a@@ in &apos;t what you do , it &apos;s the way that you do it &apos; notion .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
the philosop@@ her mar@@ th@@ a n@@ uss@@ baum points this out in this quote : &quot; th@@ us throughout history , certain dis@@ g@@ ust properties -- sli@@ min@@ ess , bad smell , sti@@ ck@@ iness , deca@@ y , f@@ ou@@ l@@ ness -- have been repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously been associated with ...
when we actually looked at not just self-@@ repor@@ ted political ori@@ entation , but vot@@ ing behavior , we were able to look geogra@@ phi@@ cally across the nation . what we found was that in regi@@ ons in which people repor@@ ted high levels of dis@@ g@@ ust sensi@@ tivity , mc@@ ca@@ in got more vot@@ es .
it makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from in@@ gest@@ ing po@@ ison should predict who i &apos;m going to vote for in the up@@ coming pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
wish i could .
mar@@ c@@ us : and how many soldiers have you rec@@ ru@@ ited to fight this war with you ?
new@@ ton a@@ du@@ ak@@ a : thank you . the first clip , really , is totally trying to capture what cin@@ em@@ a is for me , and where i &apos;m coming from in terms of cin@@ em@@ a .
you must get -- ?
oni@@ ch@@ a : e@@ z@@ ra !
we don &apos;t need no more trouble no more trouble we don &apos;t need no more trouble no more trouble . wake up ! everybody wake up . road block !
why ? because you want our diam@@ ond .
n thank you .
or we can zo@@ om out to the table of cont@@ ents , and the video kee@@ ps playing .
all right . mi@@ ke , thanks so much .
a lot of us work for people ; we &apos;re in the hands of other people .
so where do we go now ?
september 11 gener@@ ated some interest in moving it over to ground zero , and i &apos;m totally against that .
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spe@@ c buil@@ ders and it was tri@@ vi@@ alized so much that it wasn &apos;t ...
f@@ g : i don &apos;t know .
i was so proud .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .
it was a table as long as this car@@ pet and the h@@ arb@@ or com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er was here , and i was here , and my guys .
frank ge@@ hr@@ y : a master architect as@@ ks , now what ?
totally trans@@ formed by man .
these things that i photograph@@ ed -- this ti@@ re pi@@ le here had 45 million ti@@ r@@ es in it . it was the largest one .
and for me china -- i started photograph@@ ing it four years ago , and china truly is a question of sustain@@ ability in my mind , not to mention that china , as well , has a great effect on the industri@@ es that i grew up around .
this is wus@@ han , one of the largest cities that was rel@@ oc@@ ated .
what &apos;s also happening in shang@@ hai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
and i &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about effici@@ en@@ cies , but i can &apos;t imagine that every a@@ partment having its own air condi@@ tion@@ er is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .
they were just wo@@ und up doing these things all day long , until the man@@ ager had to , with a stern voice , say , &quot; okay , everybody free@@ ze . &quot;
this was one of the biggest fac@@ tor@@ ies i &apos;ve ever seen .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it &apos;s pal@@ p@@ able in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i &apos;m really hop@@ ing that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
and anything that you can do to pro@@ mote that would be fantastic .
and the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas i &apos;m playing with -- when i first saw an ima@@ x film , i almost immediately thought , &quot; there &apos;s a real res@@ on@@ ance between what i &apos;m trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photograph@@ er . &quot;
and the reason we see min@@ es is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable ra@@ w materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
plasti@@ cs have over@@ la@@ pping den@@ si@@ ties over a very nar@@ row range .
and we eventually broke the code .
we take out the things that aren &apos;t plasti@@ cs , such as the met@@ als they mis@@ sed , car@@ pe@@ ting , fo@@ am , ru@@ b@@ ber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last to@@ dd@@ ler rule just a little bit to : &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
you know , we &apos;re the smar@@ test thing out there , why can &apos;t we figure this out ?
you know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really dist@@ ant , but al@@ b@@ eit evolutionary , relative .
but this is the unit of cur@@ ren@@ cy that we &apos;ve taught our mon@@ keys at y@@ ale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food .
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start ex@@ changing money with each other .
the more surprising thing was that when we collabor@@ ated with econom@@ ists to actually look at the mon@@ keys &apos; data using economic tools , they basically mat@@ ched , not just qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively , but quanti@@ ta@@ tively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to get some money for sure .
so what &apos;s going on ?
the guy on the left is a safe bon@@ us .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two gra@@ pes every single time , or they can take a ris@@ ky bet and choose between one and three .
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to over@@ come .
thank you .
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home .
that &apos;s the change .
the engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , the easy part of this .
bom@@ b bl@@ ast cur@@ tains covered my windows .
think about it : what other business do you know , what other sector of the economy , and especially one as big as the public sector , that doesn &apos;t se@@ ek to rein@@ vent its business model on a regular basis ?
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in deli@@ vering services , sometimes where none exist , than us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di .
let me be very clear , and perhaps contro@@ versi@@ al , that open government is not about transpar@@ ent government .
we don &apos;t have words , really , to describe it yet .
in fact , she indi@@ cated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of recei@@ ving the gra@@ titude from the members of the exten@@ ded family , but she said , &quot; even god will s@@ mile , and when god s@@ miles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot;
and , like ch@@ ie@@ f se@@ attle said , &quot; we did not sp@@ in the web of life .
and he said , &quot; i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did .
and , according to jes@@ us , the word comes forth , &quot; you must love yourself , you must love the l@@ ord your god with all your heart , mind and sou@@ l , and your neighb@@ or as yourself . &quot;
i close with this song -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song -- because we are all children at the table of mama e@@ ternal .
the viet@@ na@@ m prote@@ sts , the com@@ memor@@ ation of all that died in the pan@@ de@@ mic of aids , the mar@@ ch for women &apos;s re@@ productive rights , right up until almost the present .
one re@@ de@@ em@@ ing fe@@ ature is it &apos;s li@@ f@@ ted up off the ground and it &apos;s got this vo@@ id , and it &apos;s got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that fac@@ ade very much corpo@@ rate and fe@@ der@@ al style .
and it has to be free .
that &apos;s the pan@@ the@@ on next to it .
this is the war@@ p and we@@ ft .
so i have brand@@ ed myself as a war child .
what was actually killing us wasn &apos;t the musli@@ ms , wasn &apos;t the arab@@ s .
sometimes you got@@ ta lose to win .
don &apos;t even know the day i &apos;ll ever return .
and one thing that sho@@ cked me is one day they brought an arab musi@@ cian to come and enter@@ tain the soldiers .
but that moved me .
well now , my time is going , so i want to sing a song .
he never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was preg@@ nant with him .
some of these law@@ yers were successful ; they managed to get new trials for their cli@@ ents .
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death pen@@ al@@ ty law@@ yers have understood that the earlier you interven@@ e in a case , the greater the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood that you &apos;re going to save your cli@@ ent &apos;s life .
what we &apos;re talking about today is just as complicated .
now , it was logi@@ sti@@ cally difficult .
i hope there &apos;s one thing you all won &apos;t forget : in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch , there are going to be four hom@@ i@@ ci@@ des in the united states .
i mean , s@@ ant@@ a cl@@ aus knows if you &apos;re n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty or nice , right ? &quot;
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s oc@@ tober 10 . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
now , i was raised in the pacific nor@@ th@@ west , around a lot of church of lat@@ ter-@@ day sa@@ in@@ ts people and , you know , i &apos;ve worked with them and even d@@ ated them , but i never really knew the doc@@ tr@@ ine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and i guess i was , sort of , curious , so i said , &quot; well , please , come in . &quot; and they looked really happy , because i don &apos;t think this happens to them all that often .
i said , &quot; what happened to the lam@@ an@@ ites ? &quot;
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ?
we have focused on the problems .
i believe , if ken@@ ne@@ dy was alive today , he would be asking statisti@@ cians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while .
when it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce resource that it wants to turn into a des@@ ir@@ able out@@ come , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven &apos;t been to .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
they don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satis@@ fied .
what turned out to deter@@ mine whether someone would stop and help a stran@@ ger in need was how much of a hur@@ ry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absor@@ bed in what they were going to talk about .
now this is a -- it &apos;s a little test i encoura@@ ge you to try out at a party .
right now , as bill mc@@ don@@ ough has poin@@ ted out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .
the moment i stopped , half a do@@ zen other people immediately rin@@ ged the same guy .
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that der@@ i@@ ved from it .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .
an@@ anda sh@@ ank@@ ar ja@@ y@@ ant : fighting cancer with dance
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- docum@@ ents , data ?
data is relationships .
let &apos;s think about data for a bit .
audience : ra@@ w .
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
all together , they achie@@ ved these results : increas@@ ed the number of people on anti-@@ retro@@ vir@@ als , life@@ -@@ saving anti-@@ aids drugs ; nearly hal@@ ved dea@@ ths from malaria ; vac@@ cin@@ ated so many that 5@@ .@@ 4 million lives will be saved .
now here , we see the role for an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented co@@ ali@@ tion of social media gi@@ ants and up@@ starts , tele@@ com@@ s companies , reality tv show forma@@ ts , gam@@ ing companies , tele@@ com@@ s , all of them together in kind of their &quot; we are the world &quot; moment .
it &apos;s getting near zero .
thank you , thank you .
and he said , &quot; oh , i teach at a college of arts .
so i just thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to capture th@@ um@@ b@@ print , foot@@ print , or whatever tra@@ ces we leave as humans . &quot;
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether the co@@ w cros@@ sed the road , or the road moved underneath the co@@ w , depen@@ ds on your frame of re@@ ference . &quot;
again , &quot; in@@ ward out . &quot;
and this was colle@@ cted by an@@ ap@@ um -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will ev@@ apo@@ rate .
this gave me a greater faith .
you can see the detail .
i &apos;m a little bit of an ama@@ te@@ ur histor@@ ian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earli@@ est quote that i could find was one from david li@@ v@@ ing@@ stone , writing in the 18@@ 5@@ 0s about how the ra@@ il@@ road , the ste@@ am ship , and the tele@@ graph were integr@@ ating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
so it &apos;s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , &quot; world 3@@ .@@ 0 , &quot; that we &apos;re very , very far from the no@@ -@@ bor@@ der effect ben@@ ch@@ mark , which would imp@@ ly internation@@ alization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
think of fr@@ ance and the current debate about im@@ migra@@ tion .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce con@@ temporary products , away from the eth@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more con@@ temporary .
but if we re@@ ar@@ range this for@@ mul@@ a quickly , we can get to acceler@@ ation equ@@ als force over mass , which means that for a larger partic@@ le -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te they &apos;ll do .
your brand starts being dis@@ per@@ sed , it gets more cha@@ o@@ tic .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
so , for example , you can be a pit@@ cher or a cat@@ cher , and that cor@@ respon@@ ds to whether you per@@ form a sexual act or recei@@ ve a sexual act .
can you imagine saying to your co@@ ach , &quot; u@@ h , i &apos;m not really feeling it today , i think i &apos;ll sit this game out . &quot;
&quot; well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
and sometimes that can be different amo@@ unts over different times or with different people or on different days .
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are said .
real depen@@ dence on this person .
i was just st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed by it .
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of part@@ ners .
in short , they are ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
it &apos;s one of many , many characteri@@ stics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
we &apos;re also re@@ turning to an ancient form of marriage equ@@ ality .
this is why you can feel such a sense of co@@ s@@ mic union with somebody after you &apos;ve made love to them .
dop@@ am@@ ine is associated with roman@@ tic love .
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illu@@ strate .
and everybody there agre@@ ed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
i actually just as@@ sm@@ ed the path@@ ologi@@ c sequence of events was sett@@ led science .
in fact , what if it &apos;s a symp@@ tom of a much deeper problem , the ti@@ p of a pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ic@@ e@@ berg ?
now i don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that ex@@ cess energy .
but this team of multi-@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary , highly skep@@ tical and ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly tal@@ ented researchers do agree on two things .
peter at@@ ti@@ a : is the o@@ bes@@ ity crisis hi@@ ding a bigger problem ?
so when i was born , i guess you could say expec@@ tations were kind of high for me .
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we &apos;ve got to get on with it .
frank@@ ly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic ja@@ m with no emissions is still a traffic ja@@ m .
now shared car services are also spr@@ inging up around the world , and these eff@@ or@@ ts , i think , are great .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gri@@ d@@ lock .
char@@ lie le@@ d@@ better , yesterday , i thought , talked very artic@@ ul@@ ately about this need to bring consum@@ ers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
so they sna@@ pped into action .
george de me@@ stra@@ l -- this is not bu@@ gs all over a bir@@ ken@@ stock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in bur@@ rs , sort of little pri@@ ck@@ ly things , and from that came vel@@ cr@@ o .
it &apos;s been all about these kind of thou@@ ght@@ less things that people do , which have huge inten@@ tion and huge opportunity .
i talk about un@@ thinking situations all the time .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pu@@ mp for a company called ap@@ prote@@ c , in kenya .
con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous is a good word .
and in two hours , after their bac@@ ks were broke , they were changed .
they are sk@@ ating . they are doing street plays .
k first time , a r@@ ally and a street play in a rural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why liter@@ acy is important .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infe@@ ction from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
and interest@@ ingly , as i think back , they were the first true environ@@ ment@@ alists .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not the answer .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the impli@@ cation over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i ci@@ te our own experience as a company , and i just illu@@ strate that by a small sele@@ ction of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?
round about that design period leading up to this building , i did a sk@@ et@@ ch , which we pulled out of the archi@@ ve recently .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
so really , re@@ transl@@ ating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtu@@ ally pollu@@ tion@@ -@@ free .
so there has been a project which res@@ cu@@ es the dead sea by creating a pi@@ p@@ eline , a pi@@ pe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes bu@@ ried , that will red@@ ress that , and will feed from the gul@@ f of a@@ q@@ ab@@ a into the dead sea .
it &apos;s more than one device , you know , it &apos;s rene@@ w@@ able .
and here you can see how they really cra@@ f@@ ted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quanti@@ ta@@ tive , as well as qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative , metho@@ ds to come to a final solution that is truly integr@@ ated and completely ho@@ li@@ stic with the architecture .
to me it is something from the@@ at@@ re , and i will get back to that a little bit later .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the fe@@ atures around us .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preser@@ ve dar@@ k@@ ness .
can we be more gent@@ le with light ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
is it that i write very well ?
the research gui@@ del@@ ines of u.s. national acade@@ my of sci@@ ences or research coun@@ c@@ ils of the u.@@ k .
if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be cele@@ br@@ ating that .
they could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technologi@@ cal creativity , the innova@@ tions , either in terms of con@@ temporary innova@@ tions , or in terms of traditional knowledge .
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
you bring your water , you bring your so@@ ap , i was@@ h the clo@@ th@@ es for you . charge 50 pa@@ is@@ a , one ru@@ pe@@ e for you per lot , and a new business model can emer@@ ge .
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of sc@@ aling up .
my technology .
we were talking about , my friends in brazil , how we scale up this model in china and brazil .
she said , &quot; change your prof@@ ession . &quot;
then you don &apos;t need anything to control the car , except thinking about it .
500 years ago , sa@@ il@@ ing ships started getting reli@@ able enough ; we found a new continent .
or s@@ no@@ w@@ mobil@@ es . you don &apos;t need the s@@ now .
and they bel@@ ong on the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot;
so , having seen this , and having worried about it for eight years , the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regul@@ atory guys , call a@@ ar@@ p , get an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment right away .
we &apos;ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with john@@ son &amp; amp ; john@@ son , to run an i@@ bot , because the best bat@@ ter@@ ies you could get -- 10 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m in lead , 20 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m ni@@ ck@@ el@@ -@@ c@@ ad@@ mi@@ um , 40 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m in ni@@ ck@@ el@@ -@@ metal hy@@ dri@@ de , 60 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m in li@@ thi@@ um , 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 50 wat@@ t-@@ hours of energy in every kil@@ ogra@@ m of pro@@ pan@@ e or gas@@ ol@@ ine -- which is why nobody dri@@ ves electric cars .
animal fan n@@ ell@@ ie m@@ ck@@ ay s@@ ings a spar@@ kl@@ ing tribu@@ te to her de@@ ar dog . she suggests we all do the same : &quot; just go right to the po@@ und / and find yourself a ho@@ und / and make that do@@ g@@ gie proud / &apos; cause that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the nar@@ co@@ s , the car@@ tel@@ es , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the lat@@ ter are only provi@@ ding a service to the former .
but this is the result of a very care@@ ful brand@@ ing and business strategy .
they have actually re@@ tain@@ ed access to the prof@@ it@@ able drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n , and they control the port of l@@ á@@ zar@@ o c@@ á@@ r@@ den@@ as , they le@@ verage that to , for example , trade cop@@ per from mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n that is leg@@ ally created and leg@@ ally extra@@ cted with illegal ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine from china which is a critical pre@@ cur@@ sor for meth@@ am@@ p@@ he@@ tam@@ ines that they produce , and then they have partner@@ ships with larger organizations like the sin@@ alo@@ a fe@@ der@@ ation that place their products in the u.@@ s .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynam@@ ics will continue the way they have .
and then it &apos;s time to do it again . last year .
the next phase it hit was dis@@ plac@@ ement .
here &apos;s another technology that &apos;s approach@@ ing a critical price .
you can have re@@ gener@@ ative bra@@ king ; you can have dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ y-@@ wire ; you can have re@@ plac@@ e@@ able body shapes -- it &apos;s a little thing that starts with a hy@@ bri@@ d , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it was just 199@@ 0 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
they use mo@@ bu@@ tu as metaphor .
i want to share one story about an innovation called dri@@ p ir@@ ri@@ gation .
and so we met dr. son@@ o k@@ han@@ gh@@ ar@@ an@@ i in pakistan .
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen .
and for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school .
thank you .
you have my friend , who has a blog on digital -- on p@@ dr@@ s , personal recor@@ ders .
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
i showed a nor@@ man rock@@ well painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
they &apos;re the largest of the tun@@ as , the secon@@ d-@@ largest fish in the sea -- bon@@ y fish .
the european population and north african -- the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in tun@@ a -- is fis@@ hed at tremendous levels : 5@@ 0,000 tons over the last decade almost every year .
we basically are taking the same satelli@@ te phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chi@@ ps .
now , the activi@@ ties from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
there are two villa@@ ges , har@@ r@@ is and mor@@ e@@ head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant , and together , fis@@ her@@ s worked with us to tag 800 to 9@@ 00 fish .
these become for@@ th@@ right in places we need to protect .
the tun@@ a team from top@@ p has done the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able : three teams tag@@ ged 1,@@ 700 tun@@ as , blu@@ ef@@ in , yel@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in and al@@ bac@@ ore all at the same time -- carefully re@@ he@@ ar@@ sed tag@@ ging programs in which we go out , pick up ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le tun@@ as , put in the ta@@ gs that actually have the sensor@@ s , stick out the tun@@ a and then let them go .
we did this with the great tur@@ tle race -- tag@@ ged tur@@ tles , brought in four million hits .
hi there . i &apos;m has@@ an . i &apos;m an artist .
and he looks at me really conf@@ used and says , &quot; no explo@@ si@@ ves ? &quot;
and i was like , &quot; all we need is al@@ as@@ ka not to get the last mem@@ o , and here we go all over again . &quot;
this was on del@@ ta 7@@ 19 going from j@@ f@@ k to san francisco .
all of these are extra@@ cted directly from my bank accoun@@ ts , and everything po@@ ps up right away .
and on sun@@ day , jun@@ e 14@@ th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos;@@ clock in the after@@ noon in sk@@ o@@ wh@@ eg@@ an , ma@@ ine -- this was my a@@ partment there .
because no one &apos;s really watching .
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
and now , 20@@ 12 .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art bu@@ yer at ma@@ cy &apos;s , and like so many people , he strug@@ gl@@ ed to find a new one during the rec@@ ession .
how do we mi@@ mic the way trust is built fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face online ?
it was ridi@@ cul@@ ous . i couldn &apos;t get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn &apos;t travel with me .
now the interesting thing is , repu@@ tation is the soci@@ o@@ economic lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant that makes collabor@@ ative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be gener@@ ated from , and its appli@@ cations , are far bigger than this space alone .
there &apos;s been an explosion of collabor@@ ative consumption -- web@@ -@@ powered sharing of cars , a@@ part@@ ments , skills . ra@@ ch@@ el bot@@ s@@ man explor@@ es the cur@@ ren@@ cy that makes systems like air@@ b@@ n@@ b and tas@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit work : trust , influence , and what she calls &quot; repu@@ tation capital . &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
it &apos;s simply the propor@@ tion of the population who agree most people can be tru@@ sted .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
the position of women , how clo@@ sely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the po@@ les in terms of the rich developed world .
but i should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
and of course , others using more sophisti@@ cated metho@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .
one of the key areas we &apos;ve been working on recently is medical devices , and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq &apos;s electricity grid then , there are some common@@ ali@@ ties .
how do you en@@ sure it gets to them and it impro@@ ves their lives ?
notice anything about it ?
the industry average is about 65 percent .
you &apos;ve got to pay for your so@@ ap , your de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush , to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ ste , all of it .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nur@@ ture the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al spirit and the tremendous un@@ ta@@ pped potential in our pris@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back .
second of all , it &apos;s really beauti@@ fully bal@@ an@@ ced : it hol@@ ds well , it feels well .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; you don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot;
now some people can -- cir@@ c@@ us workers , steel workers .
no big deal .
and behavi@@ oral design is all about feeling in control , which inclu@@ des us@@ ability , understanding -- but also the feel and he@@ ft .
it &apos;s kind of ne@@ at . what a wonderful design .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular rou@@ te that i had taken , the re@@ mot@@ er the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
anyway , so i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is requi@@ red where schools don &apos;t exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason .
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot;
what could they learn to do ?
a typical example being , &quot; sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . &quot;
thank you .
and i , one day , i announ@@ ced this to my parents -- and my father den@@ ies this story to this day -- i said , &quot; da@@ d@@ dy , i want to be a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at . &quot;
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
secon@@ dly , the government had ignor@@ ed all available alterna@@ tives to war , which in some ways was a more dis@@ cre@@ di@@ table thing still .
my pen@@ sion was in it .
why don &apos;t you ad@@ v@@ ise their government on their diplo@@ ma@@ cy ? &quot;
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a des@@ k in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
what this means is it &apos;s no longer good enough to say that international rela@@ tions , or global aff@@ air@@ s , or chaos in som@@ alia , or what &apos;s going on in bur@@ ma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
it &apos;s that broken experience on the web .
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or , and we had eight star@@ tu@@ ps sitting around there .
so most everyone wat@@ ches tv .
animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding ste@@ ad@@ y .
look at this green spi@@ ke in 196@@ 6 to a b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show .
glam@@ or@@ ous and rich .
that &apos;s all great , right ?
and then she cl@@ ari@@ fied . she said , &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it su@@ cks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
because , you see , dna is like a blu@@ e@@ print that tells living things what to make .
it kill@@ s me . i &apos;m not kid@@ ding .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &quot; actually . &quot;
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i ur@@ ge you to join me .
but sometimes it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ars from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens onto a sta@@ ir@@ case .
but here &apos;s the wei@@ r@@ dest place of all : war .
dur@@ k@@ heim called this level the level of the sac@@ red because he believed that the function of religion was to uni@@ te people into a group , into a moral community .
he said , &quot; if the one tri@@ be inclu@@ ded a great number of coura@@ ge@@ ous , sym@@ pa@@ thetic and fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful members who are always ready to aid and de@@ f@@ end each other , this tri@@ be would succe@@ ed better and con@@ qu@@ er the other . &quot;
and as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve dou@@ bled in size , you &apos;ll see them spli@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws .
it happened again about 120 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some soli@@ t@@ ary was@@ ps began creating little simple , primi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves .
i don &apos;t mean that we evolved to join gigan@@ tic organized religi@@ ons .
and that gives me hope because people are not pur@@ ely sel@@ fish .
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a sub@@ urban las v@@ eg@@ as neighborhood .
and the thing you really hope for is occasi@@ on@@ ally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see ton@@ ight . so .
and this gra@@ ff@@ iti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
that was it . that &apos;s all he saw as the op@@ tions . and not too far off .
and it was pur@@ pos@@ ely done to look fairly serious .
this is how the ad ran throughout the world ; germany made one s@@ light change in the ad .
the co@@ v@@ et@@ ed ri@@ ght-@@ hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s next is going to be people .
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
this is another version of that . this is a sea dra@@ g@@ on , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le that has not yet s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed the ac@@ id , has not yet taken in the brow@@ n-@@ green al@@ ga@@ e pon@@ d sc@@ um into its body to give it energy .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co-@@ evolution .
and he has decided to treat them as if they were tri@@ lo@@ bit@@ es , or sna@@ ils , and to do a mor@@ ph@@ ological analysis , and try to der@@ i@@ ve their gene@@ alo@@ gical history over time .
so we &apos;ve all heard about the am@@ ish giving up cars .
and so a ham@@ mer , when we gra@@ b a ham@@ mer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re grab@@ bing .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game exten@@ ds and continu@@ es even when you &apos;re gone .
and while a student at ha@@ wa@@ ii , i worked at the wa@@ i@@ ki@@ ki a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um .
it &apos;s been a good ride .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be@@ ak in action .
and over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4@@ ,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , for@@ cing water down through the cra@@ cks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a mag@@ ma cham@@ ber where it becomes super@@ he@@ ated and super@@ satur@@ ated with miner@@ als , rever@@ ses its flow and starts sho@@ ot@@ ing back to the surface and is e@@ je@@ cted out of the earth like a ge@@ y@@ ser at yel@@ lo@@ w@@ stone .
and that ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al nature of the hydro@@ ther@@ mal vent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that i &apos;ve seen in 35 years of travel@@ ing around , making films .
and a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people changed that bay .
now , syl@@ via &apos;s ted prize wish was to bes@@ ee@@ ch us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set asi@@ de not p@@ in pri@@ cks , but significant exp@@ ans@@ es of the ocean for preser@@ vation , &quot; hope spo@@ ts , &quot; she calls them .
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monit@@ or@@ ed by the culture .
and then i thought -- in my 4@@ 0s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
here &apos;s some numbers .
you could drop an at@@ om bom@@ b on a city , and 30 years later it &apos;s survi@@ ving .
so let &apos;s first talk about biology .
so is london a sc@@ aled up bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham , which is a sc@@ aled up bri@@ gh@@ ton , etc . , etc . ?
and we &apos;ve looked at everything : more aids cases , flu , etc .
that would be bad for econom@@ ies and cities .
but you notice , i &apos;ve che@@ ated , because i &apos;ve only gone up to &apos; 9@@ 4 .
right about the time that the internet gets going as an edu@@ cational tool , i take off from wis@@ con@@ sin and move to kan@@ s@@ as , small town kan@@ s@@ as , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lo@@ vely , small@@ -@@ town , rural kan@@ s@@ as school distri@@ ct , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government .
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in ari@@ zon@@ a , was i had this really in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to inclu@@ de an amount of failure , because failure is in@@ struc@@ tional in the process .
it &apos;s simply acceler@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a clin@@ ically relevant ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale .
4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one reti@@ re@@ e who was experi@@ en@@ cing de@@ bili@@ tat@@ ing disease .
if a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
therefore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ plant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing .
and that material in@@ duced the body to switch back on a heal@@ ing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
it &apos;s the cool@@ est stuff .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
it &apos;s very powerful work .
thank you .
oh , wonderful .
and -- oh , i saw gol@@ die ha@@ wn .
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
but then on top of that , you know , sar@@ ah j@@ ones told me we only have 18 minutes .
so , we deser@@ ve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
my name is pra@@ ve@@ en man@@ v@@ i and thank you very much for this opportunity .
my son , he says he is not ready to get married .
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even you don &apos;t realize .
that &apos;s all , shu@@ kr@@ an . thank you very much for the opportunity .
but i &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ti@@ cket to financial freedom .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
we &apos;ve sent 5@@ 0,000 d@@ v@@ ds to high school teachers in the u.@@ s .
and finally , an e@@ bay li@@ sting for one well-@@ travel@@ ed slide show , now ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , museum piece . please contact al gore .
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
it &apos;s been ta@@ ped with ta@@ pe that we even stopped using in the u.@@ k .
equipment that &apos;s ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , equipment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fix it . and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
that &apos;s what he was doing , pro@@ pping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
these are the basic fe@@ atures of my device , or our device .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i hadn &apos;t realized that the hiv / aids pan@@ de@@ mic was directly affec@@ ting women in such a way .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about 12 different countries .
a@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
our ene@@ mi@@ es shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own con@@ fusion .
but over@@ thro@@ wing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social net@@ working companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the em@@ power@@ ing potential of these plat@@ forms is being con@@ stra@@ ined because of these relationships between companies and government .
and here in the united king@@ dom there &apos;s also conc@@ ern over a law called the digital economy act that &apos;s plac@@ ing more on@@ us on private inter@@ medi@@ aries to police citi@@ zen behavior .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented expan@@ sion , now accoun@@ ting for roughly 15 percent of the world &apos;s g@@ dp .
the court system wasn &apos;t func@@ tion@@ ing proper@@ ly .
the z@@ ones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by app@@ all@@ ing violence and b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed .
so i have shown you this to demon@@ strate how many bo@@ ats , how many ves@@ sel@@ s it takes to catch one of these guys .
now , i was taken by in@@ spec@@ tor brian can@@ ter@@ a , of the ro@@ y@@ al can@@ adi@@ an moun@@ ted police , to a ca@@ vern@@ ous war@@ e@@ house east of van@@ cou@@ ver to see some of the goods which are regul@@ arly con@@ fis@@ cated by the r@@ c@@ mp from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able market for b@@ .@@ c. bu@@ d , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s market@@ ed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
ho@@ o@@ ked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated the computer security system of a major brazi@@ li@@ an bank .
there is no roman@@ ce involved with gan@@ g@@ sters in the 21@@ st century .
everybody knew the answer .
you &apos;ve believed it through generations .
all his colleagues said , &quot; this is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
the only ex@@ ception is the na@@ ked som@@ ali@@ an mole@@ -@@ rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground .
try to imagine a gor@@ ill@@ a per@@ forming the same man@@ eu@@ ver , and you can see that , compared with gor@@ ill@@ a , we are hal@@ f@@ way to being sha@@ ped like a fish .
sir david atten@@ bor@@ ough , he &apos;s come over .
acade@@ mi@@ a says no .
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
ah , mark -- ser@@ fa@@ as .
i &apos;d basically dist@@ ill@@ ed a very diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ explain and complex philosoph@@ y , which i won &apos;t get into here , because it &apos;s a little too deep for all of you , but -- it &apos;s about what makes web@@ sites popular , and , you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s un@@ fortun@@ ate that i don &apos;t have more time .
and fro@@ g mode .
it &apos;s the process of creation that kee@@ ps me sort of a bubble and a half above per@@ pe@@ tual an@@ x@@ iety in my life , and it &apos;s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not finished , and you &apos;re not starting something -- that really fil@@ ls my entire life .
i think that the &quot; now ti@@ ed up , ti@@ ed down , mi@@ stress cru@@ el approach@@ es me , now ti@@ ed down , it &apos;s up . &quot;
you can send them an email .
you may not appreci@@ ate the person , you may not appreci@@ ate anything else , but maybe you appreci@@ ate the fact that they &apos;ve got a tough gi@@ g .
so when you do that , here &apos;s what i can promise : you &apos;re going to be the 800 po@@ und gor@@ ill@@ a in the forest .
and so i went home , and i made a prototyp@@ e of this hat .
and i thought , &quot; well , hey !
this very basic shift in my physical ori@@ entation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the gl@@ aci@@ er .
yet we di@@ ther , taking no action to de@@ fle@@ ct the astero@@ id , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes . &quot;
our problem and our trage@@ dy is that in these hyper@@ -@@ par@@ tis@@ an times , the m@@ ere fact that one side says , &quot; look , there &apos;s an astero@@ id , &quot; means that the other side &apos;s going to say , &quot; hu@@ h ? what ?
it causes them to di@@ stor@@ t reality .
so , how warm or cold do you feel about , you know , na@@ tive americans , or the military , the republi@@ can party , the democratic party , all sorts of groups in american life .
but the problem isn &apos;t pri@@ mar@@ ily that we &apos;re elec@@ ting bad people to con@@ gress .
so here &apos;s another astero@@ id .
when americans go to college and mar@@ ry each other , they have very low di@@ vor@@ ce rates .
and most surpris@@ ingly to me , they sometimes can even see eye to eye on crimin@@ al justice .
and this is the con@@ version of one group of sub@@ stances into another , either through the production or the absor@@ ption of energy .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bot@@ tom@@ -up construction approach@@ es for architecture , which contr@@ ast the current , vic@@ tor@@ ian , top@@ -@@ down metho@@ ds which im@@ pose structure upon matter .
now , this is the very interesting part .
ven@@ ice is sin@@ king . to save it , ra@@ ch@@ el arm@@ strong says we need to out@@ grow architecture made of in@@ ert materials and , well , make architecture that gro@@ ws itself . she pro@@ pos@@ es a not@@ -@@ qu@@ it@@ e-@@ alive material that does its own re@@ pa@@ irs and sequ@@ est@@ ers carbon , too .
i &apos;m sc@@ ared . tell them to get away . &apos; &quot; as a young woman , i was in a psychiat@@ ric hospital on three different occasi@@ ons for l@@ eng@@ thy peri@@ ods .
this person is likely to have some form of schizophren@@ ia .
this ep@@ iso@@ de led to my first hospit@@ alization in america .
they wouldn &apos;t experience re@@ stra@@ in@@ ts as we would . &quot;
&apos;@@ okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
so let me share some final thoughts .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
second it &apos;s driving itself .
they &apos;re the v@@ eins of the ecosystem , and they &apos;re often empty v@@ eins .
and i &apos;m sure you all know , this has created significant confli@@ cts between the agri@@ cultural and environmental communities .
but they have no in@@ cen@@ tive to do so .
with stre@@ ams and ri@@ vers dr@@ ying up because of over@@ -@@ us@@ age , ro@@ b har@@ mon has imple@@ mented an in@@ geni@@ ous market mechan@@ ism to bring back the water . farmers and be@@ er companies find their f@@ ates inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed in the intri@@ gu@@ ing cent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old tale of pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but , yeah .
he &apos;s by far the happ@@ i@@ est man ever measu@@ red by science .
and maybe because of that , compassion is organic and wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad comp@@ any@@ -@@ wide .
so what are they ?
so this mu@@ tual inspiration pro@@ mot@@ es collaboration , initiative and creativity .
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
cha@@ de-@@ men@@ g tan : everyday compassion at google
and it took a lot of coura@@ ge for these defen@@ ders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in imple@@ ment@@ ing these laws .
and with that , he success@@ fully organized 6@@ 8 law@@ yers who have been syste@@ matically taking the cases .
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very coura@@ ge@@ ous law@@ yers , and said , &quot; how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is imple@@ mented ?
so i thank you for having the prop@@ he@@ tic imagination to imagine the sha@@ ping of a new world with us together , and invi@@ te you into this journey with us .
you know when they do home@@ works at home ?
it can be a school of design in jer@@ us@@ al@@ em that tries to find a better way to design gas mas@@ ks for people , because , as you know , israel de@@ plo@@ ys one gas mas@@ k per person including babies .
hell@@ a jon@@ geri@@ us is a person that is able to make a syn@@ thesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hil@@ ari@@ ous .
so , designers sometimes don &apos;t do things that are immediately func@@ tional , but they &apos;re func@@ tional to our understanding of issues .
and that makes sense .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loo@@ p with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about .
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got ki@@ cked out pretty much every term .
my father , who i &apos;ve been talking about , died of aids in 199@@ 9 .
how would you look at me ?
so we need to start getting better .
and i can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that enough , you know .
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of no@@ where .
a cou@@ sin of mine died of aids , left an or@@ ph@@ an , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
and this is just an illu@@ stration .
long distance running was not only good for my well-@@ being but it helped me medi@@ tate and dream big .
but for every disaster we had , the mar@@ ath@@ on found ways to bring people together .
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
he was out there in par@@ ol deli@@ vering a baby .
she is really the center of the health care system .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to every clin@@ ic in the world .
in may of 2010 , at 35 years old , with a two-@@ year-old at home and my second child on the way , i was diagno@@ sed with a large an@@ eur@@ y@@ s@@ m at the base of my th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic a@@ or@@ ta .
so these are my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
most of the people who lived here either lived in co@@ ast@@ al villa@@ ges , fishing , or were no@@ ma@@ ds who ro@@ am@@ ed around with the environment trying to find water .
this is probably the sky@@ line that most of you know about do@@ ha .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
these risks directly affect the sustain@@ ability of this nation and its continu@@ ity .
imagine a country with ab@@ und@@ ant power -- oil and gas , s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine , wind -- but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fa@@ had al-@@ at@@ ti@@ ya talks about the un@@ expected ways that the small middle eastern nation of q@@ at@@ ar creates its water supply .
i &apos;ll try where it all started in the middle east , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east .
you see nine pres@@ identi@@ al can@@ di@@ dat@@ es running against lu@@ k@@ as@@ hen@@ ko .
so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place , shou@@ ting and showing off in front of the security forces .
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and che@@ aper .
2011 was a year of extraordinary peop@@ le-@@ powered resi@@ stance , starting with arab spring and spre@@ ading across the world . how did this resi@@ stance work so well ? s@@ r@@ d@@ ja po@@ po@@ vi@@ c la@@ ys out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs -- from non@@ violent tac@@ tics to a sense of humor . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i said , &quot; do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of du@@ m@@ b ? &quot;
the majority of people .
i &apos;m a fif@@ th generation tex@@ an .
and the purpose is not to walk in and constru@@ ct a home and live there .
this is like the failure conference .
us .
sh@@ ame feels the same for men and women , but it &apos;s organized by gender .
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who &apos;s just had it , she can &apos;t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &quot; i un@@ lo@@ aded the dis@@ h@@ was@@ her , &quot; but he really li@@ stens -- because that &apos;s all we need -- i &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work .
it is a dream of man@@ kind to fly like a bird .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
and the ir@@ ony is that they don &apos;t need to be .
dr. v : see , mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s &apos; concept is simple .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent pen@@ et@@ ration in the market that it ser@@ ved , which is over 5@@ 0,000 people .
the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy mar@@ g@@ in while you &apos;re tre@@ ating a large number of people for free .
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
it is a mobile ph@@ one-@@ sha@@ ped box that has an ir@@ on weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
as humans , we are social , we are em@@ path@@ ic , and that &apos;s great .
but even though i had this new@@ found joy and freedom , people &apos;s reaction completely changed towards me .
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of foc@@ using on loss or limit@@ ation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspe@@ c@@ tives .
but even more stri@@ king than the fer@@ o@@ cious power e@@ man@@ ating from that well was the re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness with which that power was un@@ le@@ as@@ hed -- the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , the lack of planning that characteri@@ zed the operation from dri@@ ll@@ ing to cle@@ an-@@ up .
a range of explan@@ ations may be po@@ pping into your mind by now , like &quot; gre@@ ed . &quot;
i &apos;m showing it because -- they &apos;re not a spon@@ sor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a cr@@ ass version of our fo@@ unding story .
ignor@@ e those cre@@ eping fe@@ ars that we have finally hit the wall .
that &apos;s a person down there by the whe@@ el .
a new fron@@ tier has been found .
bf : ... without a ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur gr@@ ant .
bf : that &apos;s all right , he does that . all right .
dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
could you just push that ?
bf : ten years to perfect , which you &apos;re about to see .
the design of the body is a whole different thing .
dh : tell them about our bi@@ o and stuff .
and it &apos;s aw@@ fully win@@ dy over there .
because now , to make this twice as difficult , we &apos;ll ju@@ g@@ gle the seven clu@@ bs back ...
i &apos;ll spend a fortun@@ e on it . i &apos;ve got a better idea .
if you &apos;ve ever seen an electr@@ on microscop@@ e picture , you &apos;ll see this . this all looks the same , then there &apos;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
now , some people call her the first program@@ mer .
to give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1@@ k of memory .
i came here to speak about ec@@ ology , and i em@@ it@@ ted as much co2 as a fren@@ ch@@ man in one year .
according to scientists , in 100 years all the mountain gl@@ aci@@ er will be gone .
i launched a project named six billion others .
you shouldn &apos;t worry about me . dad doesn &apos;t need to go to work .
it is about the state of the planet .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
chromo@@ some one , top left .
world population , p@@ c plac@@ ements , the archi@@ ve of all the medical liter@@ ature , mo@@ ore &apos;s law , the old way of sequen@@ cing , and here &apos;s all the new stuff .
so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have sever@@ e , profound if you will , impli@@ cations to her family .
but the gene that regul@@ ates that down is broken .
th@@ ank@@ fully , i was able to answer a , and i say that hon@@ est@@ ly in case my life in@@ sur@@ ance ag@@ ent is listening .
and so imagine one more thing : that that software is able to ask both par@@ ties for mu@@ tual con@@ s@@ ents , &quot; would you be willing to meet your third cou@@ sin ? &quot;
hands it back to me . and we do that again and again .
so why should you care ? bone mar@@ row is a very rich source of adult stem cells .
these cor@@ als can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have sur@@ fing sc@@ ars to prove that .
and things can happen only if these inter@@ actions are perfectly bal@@ an@@ ced .
finally , there &apos;s the force of gravity , which inter@@ acts with matter via its mass and sp@@ in .
so the electro@@ magnetic and we@@ ak forces are described by this pattern of partic@@ le char@@ ges in two-@@ dimensional space .
from this pattern , we already know the partic@@ le physics of these tiny sc@@ ales . the way the universe works with these tiny sc@@ ales is very beautiful .
each point in this pattern cor@@ respon@@ ds to a symme@@ try of this very complex and beautiful shape .
if the l@@ h@@ c fin@@ ds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e@@ 8 theory .
but not wor@@ rying about r@@ ent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to make this any clear@@ er .
so it rema@@ ins for me to com@@ ment on the ways in which chimpanze@@ es are so like us , in certain aspe@@ cts of their behavior .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanze@@ es , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habit@@ ats .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most cru@@ cial issues that we &apos;re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being pollu@@ ted by agri@@ cultural , industrial and hou@@ se@@ hold chemicals that still are being spra@@ yed around the world , seem@@ ingly with the in@@ ability to profit from past experience .
see the bri@@ ck wall as all these problems we &apos;ve in@@ fli@@ cted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids .
all of these technologies we can use .
thank you .
i &apos;d go to the super@@ market and all of my food is pac@@ ka@@ ged in plastic .
we can cut the stem -- ti@@ de the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves .
and yes , you also interact using natural gest@@ ures , both hands , etc .
my student pr@@ an@@ a@@ v , who &apos;s really , like i said , the geni@@ us behind this .
but when people learned what her son was acc@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ pathy .
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
so , ai@@ ch@@ a , do you have a couple of words for conclu@@ sion ?
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
so nothing is getting through .
that &apos;s not dir@@ ty enough . let &apos;s just sti@@ r that up a little bit .
then , after a few weeks , we set up cam@@ ps .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um goal &apos;s target of hal@@ ving the number of people without access to safe drin@@ king water .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to re@@ fer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
the world needs an international for@@ um .
up until now , the united states has been the domin@@ ant fe@@ ature of our world .
take the last financial crisis after the second world war .
diplo@@ ma@@ cy is about man@@ aging the inter@@ relationship of nations .
but now one final thing .
the other 90 percent is dic@@ t@@ ated by our lifest@@ yle .
we are progra@@ mm@@ ed for something called pro@@ creative success .
but life expec@@ tan@@ cy in this country is only 7@@ 8 .
that &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
it &apos;s simply a little saying these people say before their me@@ al to re@@ mind them to stop eating when their sto@@ mach is &#91; 80 &#93; percent full .
they inst@@ antly knew why they wo@@ ke up in the morning .
they take their diet directly from the bi@@ ble .
she ri@@ des her bi@@ cycle .
the o@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans have this ance@@ st@@ or v@@ ener@@ ation .
dan bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner : how to live to be 100 +
i &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-@@ tech com@@ pos@@ ites our future will be made of .
electr@@ on@@ ics k@@ its are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts in@@ her@@ ent in their design influence the way we learn .
i was a young driver out on the high@@ way , and the car in front of me , i saw the bra@@ ke lights go on .
and i believe that . i believe that .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty pre@@ cise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
but i believe it can be done in a way that prote@@ cts our priv@@ acy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i don &apos;t really know about you .
you can get eight , 10 minutes of wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness -- how nasa &apos;s trained their astron@@ au@@ ts for so long .
once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness was truly like .
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illu@@ str@@ ator -- since i was taught anima@@ tion by my father , who was a sculp@@ tor and my visual ment@@ or -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sci@@ ences by using anima@@ tion , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evi@@ dent to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood .
they pass information to each other .
so i pac@@ ked my c@@ at , my ro@@ tt@@ wei@@ ler and my cam@@ ping ge@@ ar into a 197@@ 5 ch@@ ev@@ y van , and dro@@ ve off into the sun@@ set , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
and i fac@@ ed a whole new set of challenges .
i started laugh@@ ing because it got to the point where , was i a writer , or was i a hom@@ eless woman ?
be@@ cky blan@@ ton : the year i was hom@@ eless
we were so much bigger than co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a in those days .
un@@ cle gets dr@@ un@@ k , doesn &apos;t use con@@ dom . come back , start again . &quot;
and here is this , then , young man called wil@@ ly bo@@ h@@ m who worked for the us@@ aid .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
of course i can . and they &apos;d enjoy it im@@ men@@ sely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere .
90 percent of the fund@@ ing came from th@@ a@@ il@@ and .
and then we have silk , th@@ ai silk .
me@@ cha@@ i vi@@ ra@@ va@@ i@@ dy@@ a : how mr. con@@ dom made th@@ a@@ il@@ and a better place
so i can see everything that ro@@ mo sees , and i get a robot &apos;@@ s-@@ e@@ ye@@ -@@ view of the world .
thanks , scot@@ t .
there &apos;s a je@@ wish saying that i love .
however , what matters most -- more than training or lu@@ ck -- is the heart .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wr@@ in@@ kl@@ es ?
somehow she man@@ ages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to pre@@ ma@@ ture tw@@ ins .
fe@@ min@@ ism has never been sex@@ y , but let me as@@ sure you that it never stopped me from fli@@ r@@ ting , and i have sel@@ dom suff@@ ered from lack of men .
jen@@ ny is horri@@ fied at what she has done , but then the transl@@ ator explains that the patient &apos;s condition has nothing to do with the operation .
does it make sense to participa@@ te in the exi@@ sting world order ?
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
it &apos;s something that i &apos;ve worked on and a few other people , and it indi@@ c@@ ates a kind of hier@@ arch@@ y along with some assu@@ mp@@ tions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected a very different theory , a much more popular one , and an older one , due lar@@ gely to john n@@ ash of &quot; a beautiful mind &quot; f@@ ame , is what &apos;s called equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um analysis .
so what you see here is a sub@@ tra@@ ction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer .
it &apos;s good for them . they make a lot of money .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanze@@ es about five million years ago .
they &apos;re also very obs@@ essed with status .
co@@ lin c@@ amer@@ er : neuro@@ science , game theory , mon@@ keys
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &apos;t actually value it .
the answer is what i call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can tra@@ ce food coming in to it .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
u@@ top@@ ia was actually a word that thomas mo@@ ore used deli@@ ber@@ ately .
ste@@ aming pil@@ es of hu@@ mus .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
and the religi@@ ons that should be making a major contribu@@ tion are instead seen as part of the problem .
i want them to get the media involved because the media are cru@@ cial in helping to dis@@ solve some of the stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical vie@@ ws we have of other people , which are divi@@ ding us from one another .
kar@@ en arm@@ strong : let &apos;s re@@ vi@@ ve the golden rule
you de@@ code what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of an@@ gles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of an@@ gles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string .
if you have er@@ r@@ ors , you can replace a part .
sk@@ yl@@ ar ti@@ b@@ bits : can we make things that make themselves ?
and obviously there &apos;s been tremendous practical appli@@ cations associated with this world -- things like the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of small@@ po@@ x , the ad@@ vent of a v@@ acc@@ ine against cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human pa@@ pil@@ lo@@ ma@@ virus .
that as we explore these str@@ ings of a &apos;s , t &apos;s , c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we may un@@ cover a completely new class of life that , like bei@@ jer@@ in@@ ck , will fundament@@ ally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
and especially if you reg@@ ard these two as deep tru@@ ths to live by and to in@@ form your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other .
now how do we know about an environment that &apos;s so far away , and so different , and so alien , from anything we &apos;re used to ?
we happen to get round to testing , let &apos;s say , new@@ ton &apos;s law of gravity about 300 years ago .
all it takes is for a super@@ no@@ va to go off a few light years away , and we &apos;ll all be dead !
the world is bu@@ z@@ zing at the moment with plans to force re@@ duc@@ tions in gas emissions at all costs .
so it has nei@@ ther the resources , nor the in@@ centi@@ ves , to ho@@ ok up many other users .
zo@@ om in on haiti , in out@@ line here .
but den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing instin@@ c@@ tively understood the importance of off@@ ering choices to his people .
we also need the choices for people .
let us have a h@@ ong kon@@ g ne@@ ar@@ by .
they can get basic u@@ tili@@ ties like electricity .
let &apos;s have a system where we have ow@@ ner@@ ship of land that is regi@@ ster@@ ed in a government office , that people can ple@@ dge as coll@@ at@@ er@@ al .
we just take se@@ a@@ water and we filter it , and we collect different size organisms on different fil@@ ters , and then take their dna back to our lab in rock@@ ville , where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours .
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .
this is a case where the software now buil@@ ds its own hard@@ ware , and that &apos;s the no@@ tions that we have with biology .
after these genom@@ es are syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed , the first step is just transplan@@ ting them into a cell without a genome .
genom@@ ics pi@@ one@@ er cra@@ ig vent@@ er takes a break from his epi@@ c ro@@ und@@ -@@ the-@@ world expedi@@ tion to talk about the millions of genes his team has discovered so far in its qu@@ est to map the ocean &apos;s bio@@ diversity .

you can be pres@@ ent@@ -@@ he@@ don@@ i@@ stic , nam@@ ely you focus on the jo@@ ys of life , or pres@@ ent@@ -@@ f@@ at@@ alist -- it doesn &apos;t matter , your life is controlled .
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but i think the consequences are really profound .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
in fact , just studying the r@@ ings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the dis@@ cs of stars and gas that we call the spi@@ ral galaxies .
it can was@@ h the s@@ lu@@ dge off high mountain pe@@ a@@ ks and h@@ ills , down into the lo@@ w@@ lands . so stop and think for a minute .
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was cele@@ br@@ ated in europe , in germany , and the cele@@ br@@ atory pres@@ ent@@ ations were given in english acc@@ ents , and american acc@@ ents , and ger@@ man acc@@ ents , and french and itali@@ an and du@@ tch acc@@ ents .
this is an un@@ con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated ground that is suff@@ used with liquid me@@ than@@ e .
my team and i have exam@@ ined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from cas@@ sin@@ i .
these leaders are trying to for@@ ge a massive national non@@ violent movement to end the occu@@ pa@@ tion and build peace in the region .
repor@@ ter : isra@@ el@@ i bor@@ der police were sent to dis@@ per@@ se the crowd .
but that &apos;s true for adults too .
juli@@ a b@@ ach@@ a : pay attention to non@@ violence
this is an invi@@ tation to the 70 percent of our un@@ ma@@ pped planet .
so epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monit@@ or@@ ing .
so if we take some out@@ bo@@ und path -- perhaps we park and we wan@@ der off -- we know because our own mov@@ ements , which we can integra@@ te over this path roughly what the head@@ ing direction is to go back .
so if this was happening , your memor@@ ies could start by place cells activ@@ ating each other via these den@@ se inter@@ connections and then re@@ activ@@ ating boundar@@ y cells to create the spa@@ tial structure of the scene around your vie@@ w@@ point .
as it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
they &apos;re beauti@@ fully designed , simple to use and user friend@@ ly .

the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for lang@@ ley .
the next 3@@ 4 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your la@@ g@@ gar@@ ds .
it &apos;s a commercial example .
how do you do that ?
leaders hold a position of power or auth@@ ority , but those who lead inspi@@ re us .
the doctors , it seemed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might .
so when i got this email from dr. gei@@ ger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
and we cho@@ se to use the pres@@ cri@@ ption for that purpose .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of shor@@ t-@@ term work@@ force to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare leadership pi@@ p@@ eline who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clin@@ ic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
the bad news is , this is a se@@ mi@@ -@@ sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble run by drug car@@ tel@@ s .

u.n. opened their stati@@ stic dat@@ ab@@ ases , and we have a new version of the software up working as a bet@@ a on the net , so you don &apos;t have to down@@ load it any longer .
and this was 2007 .
and look here -- compare to the phili@@ pp@@ ines of today .
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .
but ho@@ ma@@ ge to sing@@ apo@@ re .
this we can call dollar street .
that &apos;s when research fun@@ ctions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
i would say that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .
let me first grade what are the most important means .
so the seem@@ ingly impossible is possible .
because it &apos;s got all those a &apos;s lin@@ ed up i guess .
we can run the sc@@ ore up against anybody , and then get our as@@ ses ki@@ cked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation war@@ f@@ are .
and the chinese said to me , &quot; dr. bar@@ nett , you &apos;re absolutely right .
like sa@@ d@@ dam , like mu@@ gabe , like k@@ im jon@@ g-@@ il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .
do you want to do it , fr@@ ance ?
would you like mu@@ gabe gone ?
we bought one military and we oper@@ ated another .
can of wh@@ up ass , the net@@ working force .
the rule is going to be this .
i &apos;ve been told by the revolution of military aff@@ air@@ s crowd for years , we can do it faster , che@@ aper , smaller , just as le@@ th@@ al .
sh@@ inse@@ ki was right with the argument .
thanks .
really , we &apos;re doing this , basically . really , not very much .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn &apos;t do a very good comp@@ en@@ sation .
but then i found out that there were all sorts of pa@@ pers already published that add@@ ressed this top@@ ic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere .
maybe another kno@@ b is a kno@@ b for controll@@ ing co2 concent@@ ra@@ tions .
i &apos;ll tell you how big the le@@ ver is : the le@@ ver is that big .
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the under@@ lying reason that it &apos;s been poli@@ tically un@@ accep@@ table to talk about this .
we &apos;re going to go on a di@@ ve to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lo@@ vely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black world .
let &apos;s take a look at it again . watch the color@@ ation : white on the right , brown on the left .
i thought it was all graphi@@ cs -- so here it is in rever@@ se .
&quot; we don &apos;t care about being happy . we need to live with passion .
i used to be a fan of b@@ ach . i used to play it on the gu@@ it@@ ar , you know .
but there &apos;s also wick@@ ed joy , you can re@@ jo@@ ice in someone &apos;s suffering .
at the opposite , everyone knows deep within that an act of sel@@ fl@@ ess gener@@ osity , if from the distance , without anyone knowing anything about it , we could save a child &apos;s life , make someone happy .
ben@@ evol@@ ence , lo@@ ving kin@@ dness against hat@@ red .
so that &apos;s what those great medi@@ tat@@ ors have been doing .
so , i &apos;ve no time to go into all the different scientific results .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chem@@ ist turned budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ k mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u ri@@ card says we can train our minds in hab@@ its of well-@@ being , to generate a true sense of ser@@ en@@ ity and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
a public place so dis@@ mal that the win@@ os don &apos;t even want to go there .
ok .
and we &apos;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dra@@ g@@ ging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .
so they take the first one that comes along , often .
we &apos;re going to have to re-@@ learn what the building blocks of these things are : the street , the block , how to com@@ pose public space that &apos;s both large and small , the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the ci@@ vi@@ c square and how to really make use of this property .
please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth car@@ ing about and a nation that will be worth defen@@ ding .
the deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water .
here &apos;s a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in 199@@ 9 .
i mean , i cut through three years of engineering meetings , design and system integra@@ tion , and introduced dep@@ th@@ x -- deep ph@@ re@@ a@@ tic ther@@ mal explor@@ er .
the government recently announ@@ ced plans to return to the moon by 20@@ 24 .
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10@@ th the price ?
it &apos;s ris@@ ky and it &apos;s going to be one hell of a ride -- better than dis@@ ney .
100 years after sir ern@@ est sha@@ ck@@ le@@ ton wrote these words , i in@@ tend to plant an industrial fla@@ g on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space fron@@ tier , in our time , for all of us .
so i &apos;ve seen life as one long learning process .
i mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the virg@@ in brand for that as well ?
rb : ah , that was quite fun . that was a wonderful car@@ -@@ boat in which -- oh , that car that we -- actually we -- it was a ted@@ ster event there , i think .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
and you inspired an ian m@@ ce@@ w@@ an novel i think with that .
didn &apos;t -- weren &apos;t you just terrible at school ?
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too co@@ dd@@ led , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to raise a generation of privi@@ le@@ ged ...
that is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
we need to try to encoura@@ ge people to come up with a way of extra@@ cting carbon out of the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
i mean , the psych@@ ologist er@@ ik eri@@ k@@ son says that -- as i understand him and i &apos;m a total ama@@ te@@ ur -- but that during 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s people are driven by this desire to grow and that &apos;s where they get their ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
