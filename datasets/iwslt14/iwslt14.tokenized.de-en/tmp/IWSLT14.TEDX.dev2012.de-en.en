yes , hello .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
yes , so , what is biohacking ?
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , biohacking deals with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into biohacking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theoretically into practice .
so these were my prime motives .
so it was curiosity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
there are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the usa who &apos;s trying to produce biofuel , biodiesel fuel made from algae .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes .
and the list can go on forever .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went delved into it more .
so what why hacking ?
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
computer hacking , and then in the media it &apos;s yes , hackers break into a place and steal data and so on .
that &apos;s rather sad for the hacker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
software hackers started building computers in the seventies and eighties and this gave rise to the internet .
and it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of posing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electronics sector where you also find a whole tinkerer scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuits .
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cybernetic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also hack into it , that &apos;s it , and i thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really delve into that .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
there &apos;s hackteria dot org , which originally comes from switzerland , and it &apos;s a network based in europe with a cooperation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
those are it has a more arty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosophers are working , together with scientists , on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively , there are museum exhibitions and , well , all sorts of things .
but the point is to always find a a really loose approach to it , to deal with it playfully .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio- dot-org , diy bio .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a forum , where you where people can meet and discuss things online .
they are geared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to briefly describe .
this picture on the left is of biocurious , that &apos;s a hackerspace , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to .
children , elderly people , all sorts of people go there to simply examine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory protocols .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in indonesia , house of natural fibers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
they look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes , also electronic tinkering , and combine this in a very outlandish way .
a group from ankara , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain dna to people .
and in this other image at the top i have a lecture in in copenhagen at the medical museion in combination with an exhibition on the topic .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody , is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it and approaching society very targetedly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
so , okay , to hack into biology , you need material .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely distant ones , for professional staff , trained academics with a doctor &apos;s degree etc. only .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true .
and so with this premises with this premises , brian degger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini-laboratory , took a pressure cooker , a hot plate and , yes , soup stock , and bred bacteria with it , working like this .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a soup gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secondhand equipment on ebay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a paternity test , so dna fingerprinting in other words , at home again .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to briefly mention a project .
that here is biocurious , the hackerspace i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology .
and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s a relatively relatively heterogeneous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organisations , who are doing this more formally in an institutionalised form already .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “ scene ” , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always chatting there and everything .
and then the founder of do-it-yourself-bio dot org came and said : okay
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organised two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shortly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and what what are our values and what are what are our objectives , our fundamental principles ?
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct .
that was really intuitive , i mean , everyone expressed their wishes , their and things that move them .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
and that was then it &apos;s not binding , but it &apos;s yes , i think it has managed to become accepted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there .
so i think we from the biohacker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the academic world .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
a project i set up myself with the hackteria network in switzerland , was one in which we wanted to create a so-called optical trap or optical tweezers .
this is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then trapped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tractor beam .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a webcam , dismantled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold magnification approximately .
you can see this at the bottom .
and then we took apart a dvd burner and took out the burner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so anyhow .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an eeg or something like that , so he was working with neurobiology , his his nickname is sam neurohack .
he then made this this this helmet , and it took place in in cooperation with the museum .
visitors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this helmet .
their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the roomwent switched on .
was a very a very fancy project .
another thing from the usa that also had to do with paternity test thing , is the the pcr , the polymerase chain reaction , a complicated term .
this is about the copying of genes , replicating genes , dna , fragments , so that you can make them visible .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what profilers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair samples , and then they make these implement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like that .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercially , they start at about four thousand euros at the least .
and that &apos;s not within the range of amateurs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
so that &apos;s just one application among many that you can use .
and they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so freely available hardware and electronics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s that &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which shoots about this far , two centimetres or so .
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at onions and made them light up and stuff like that .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my my prototype , which looked pretty wild though , on a branch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
then i took a whipped cream dispenser and connected it to that .
a whipped cream dispenser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about forty to sixty bar .
and with that you can accelerate the particles strongly enough and then they enter the onions .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fifteen thousand euros or so , whereas whipped cream dispensers cost about fifty euros .
so the it &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically doable .
so that &apos;s currently the the core objective of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and comprehensibility , so that that more people can get involved .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it .
because if you just read about it in secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and this trades under the names open knowledge and citizen science .
so as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core concern of of biohackers .
those are the people who are at least officially registered on the website , the diy-bio-dot-org-website .
there &apos;s already a rather impressive number of people worldwide .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also represented in south-east-asia .
that is i think they are less people have registered than actually exist .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t registered .
and they are just the biohackers , individuals .
some of them are also registered together with the hackerspaces , those places .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
and hackerspaces , so computer hackerspaces , c-base in berlin was the first , in nineteen ninety-five .
and that &apos;s become a gigantic network of very good , well , infrastructure centres , which are being represented all over the world .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll expand in a similar way and also be similarly networked , so that more people can get involved .
and i would like to invite everyone to work on it and event try something yourselves .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
thanks for listening .
that was all .
yes , hello .
how do we humans actually function ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relevance in the area of in the research area usability and especially in the area user experience .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible .
i think that interactive media address archaic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transports you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our archaic roots .
so what are archaic models ?
i wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly .
archaic models are models that we adopted in pre-industrial times .
intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality .
that might sound unusual at first .
i will clarify this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtuality .
and the second aspect is that since we because of these archaic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual manner , although we use a codified language today .
and the third area speaks for itself really .
we all know that interactive media is , by definition , non-linear , which involves the negation of linearity , and which of course tells us that we consider linearity normal today .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
but how is it with with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i would like to prove that to you .
how many doors does the house you live in have ?
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many doors there are .
that is exactly what you are doing .
you are virtualising the reality without a computer .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
at the media campus , for example , we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-industrial times bitterly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
and they didn &apos;t have photolithography .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their mind .
and in this mind they had memory .
in this mind knowledge was retrieved , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and that &apos;s why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
yes , that &apos;s possible .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simultaneously the media producer and medium .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
what is the media today ?
you will notice that a change has taken place .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
a crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories .
shamans , priests , so-called keepers of knowledge , were specially assigned to preserve knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very dependent on stories .
according to the author of the book the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschall , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the reception of stories .
that means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life receiving stories .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the lap of our parents .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-industrial cultures .
what is particularly impressive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we &apos;ve anchored the ability to think in a non-linear way in our biological memory .
i brought along an example of the north american tribe of the nootka indians .
they live lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navigate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and they did this using so-called lead maps .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the australian aboriginals .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but used so-called songlines , or dreampaths
and the interesting thing about that is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs .
and for them language had inferior importance .
that means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
at least not to navigate .
what what happened there ?
what happened is the the so-called machine age .
before this , we were in the so-called age of feudalism .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photolithography .
and what happened is that we transferred the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to external media .
to the book and to the image .
the consequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise .
virtuality has suddenly become something alien to us
and has nothing more to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise .
let &apos;s make a short provisional appraisal .
from the age of feudalism to the to the machine age .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
those are the declining influences of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they will they have been increasingly overwritten during the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
we no longer produce .
we have an abstract an abstracted language .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codify them through language .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a linear fashion .
and we &apos;ve accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non-linearity .
what &apos;s left is storytelling .
we &apos;re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage .
the question is , what will come next ?
we had the age of feudalism , we have had the machine age and we are now stepping into the so-called cyber age .
that sounds very spacey and like science fiction , i know .
but the concepts of the cyber age , they are returning these these possibilities to rediscover our abilities .
this is about virtuality , about non-linearity , about storytelling .
i &apos;d like to explain that a little more .
there are technical concepts such as “ augmented reality ” .
so if you think of the google glasses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again .
another example is so-called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non-existent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the holodeck .
and other another example are the ambient , intelligent systems .
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real living space .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final bachelor &apos;s projects by michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
i brought this project along as an example to illustrate how these archaic , cognitive models are being addressed again .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
which of course very much accommodates for storytelling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imagining a number of persons people jumping around in front of some game consoles or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game console .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
this is a game for outside .
and it was expressly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to rediscover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
you can explain this much more elaborately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned positively or negatively on twitter .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impression , because i see negative and positive zones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we can take a look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we &apos;re about to see .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
using a kind of torch , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
right , i &apos;d like to summarise my my presentation by stating that the characteristics and abilities that we acquired during the age of feudalism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be reactivated with the help of the so-called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
i was just asked whether this sack is a talking sack and will talk for me .
it won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll be revealing what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the suspense .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn transforms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a jolt et cetera .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with besides your existence as a designer .
when professors become curious , they are often shoved into a research semester .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
a research semester on the topic natural user interface design .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , archaic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so if we look at the development of our society , summarised briefly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
from the modern to the computer society .
each society is characterised by one primary medium .
in the beginning there was the tribal society , characterised by language .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same cave or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this tribal society .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very lively .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it successively and relatively naturally .
that was then replaced by the classical age and the first type of abstraction .
that was a massive outcry at the time , because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing , meaning that i took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it .
depending on how and when i carve , a very different kind of coverage comes into being compared to when someone expresses it in a lively form , so to speak .
but gradually the written form became the primary medium , and gained a foothold .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still primarily at .
that &apos;s the medium of print with gutenberg and others .
that was also an affront at the time , where the gentry , clergymen and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomenal phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experiencing it .
of course it totally confuses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , socil social media , facebook etc .
with its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena , because i want to cover that up and not confess to it .
and these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clashing with each other at the moment .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanisms , principles and archaic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tribal society .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global theme .
not , if i am environmentally aware here on the local level and the neighbour is less environmentally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete transparency .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
we &apos;re accumulating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re accumulating it increasingly quicker and better , for example .
just like it used to happen in the village .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forgotten , and what is instinctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
so you have to examine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be improved too .
and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
so even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and perceptual psychology .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and what does intuitive mean and how do our channels of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ?
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friendly or intuitively manageable , and what does that mean fundamentally .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven officially recognised senses , and in the near future the next , the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
and just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally manageable as possible .
and of course how design affects perception .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a confusing way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is salt and which one is pepper , or i can basically design them intuitively , by showing things .
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a container , i can directly see which one contains salt and which one contains pepper .
and if i say to someone , pass me the salt or the pepper , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
with the left they &apos;d just intuitively grab it and then pass me the salt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .
but our perception , how it deceives us too .
for example perception in this context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equally big , and yet our perception changes , depending on the context we place things in .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should also work .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glasses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle is starting to correlate or associate a certain similarity .
and if i then place a half oval next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
this is called a law of design or gestalt psychology , which in turn affects our perception .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
the law of proximity , the law of of continuity , etc .
they are usually forgotten by the third term .
but it &apos;s an essential component , if you want to design things as intuitively as possible .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
that might sound mundane at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
that &apos;s wrong .
first you see from back to front .
because you project an assumption that you &apos;re seeing something you recognise to the front , such as a circle .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
i have this cognitive feedback , you projected something you want to see .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the span of milliseconds in which these things happen .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognises what .
does anyone see anything specific ?
a dalmatian , exactly .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a dalmatian in this , you know it .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the dalmatian is .
now you see the dalmatian .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
that means i &apos;ve corrupted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve conditioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this obscure image .
and that &apos;s the projection of seeing , feedback , seeing .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a dalmatian to the front .
then i see the dalmatian .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accordingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a grey area , but in this rose-tinted area .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
a long time , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bridging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occupied for three seconds .
he will have to process that as the present .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegant way , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes twenty-five milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
another very exciting phenomenon .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have .
that means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perceive things .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accordingly .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the topic of perceptions and neural processes or cognitive ergonomics , but primarily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
on the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so formal aspects or formal aesthetic aspects .
there are indicator functions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
but there are also symbolic functions ; why does someone spend such horrendous sums of money on such a little bag that you can hardly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practical ?
we &apos;re more on the symbolic , on the semantic level there , something we designers are also preoccupied with .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is usability of course .
usability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satisfying way possible .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something as user friendly as possible ?
can i handle it directly or do i need a manual or a correspondent training .
and then it &apos;s less usable or user friendly .
making it differently or prettier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why ninety-nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable , including the ipad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intuitive than classical software .
intuitive usability didn &apos;t start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when apple appeared on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devices usable for people .
why ?
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of usability , so natural user interfaces .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your employer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accordingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neural model or mental model , as software ergonomists say , because you &apos;d have a conception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
so no more zeros and ones with cryptic codes , but a metaphor .
that made the whole thing considerably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
the next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behaviour a lot more .
so , as a designer , i design behaviour much more much more often than appearance .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that i can suddenly that the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and usability is becoming an application .
and if i go a step further in these natural user interfaces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gesture rather than a mouse and cursor , then i am even faster and more immediate .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive ?
if they become more intuitive and then i have to rough-handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive ergonomics , when is something really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intuitive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
so apparently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
it means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
that means i can transfer an intuitive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software considerably more user friendly .
that poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
it &apos;s the so-called osit model .
we all use it , and osit is an acronym that stands for orient , select , inform , transact .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it unconsciously and , well , pretty intuitively and also instinctively in part .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s womb and it &apos;s intercultural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
osit in itself is used by us fifty to seventy thousand times depending on the activity , it was ascertained that when you sleep it is strained less than in the day .
i can transfer this performance model orient , select , inform , transact to an interaction system .
and this kind of transferal , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of user friendliness than the transferal of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desktop .
and if i now transfer this , if i let orient take shape as an overview , select as a selection , inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , transact means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping , etc . ,
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
everybody was having some cake earlier .
overview : i &apos;m interacting with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in .
i get the entire overview , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with chocolate , for example .
and suddenly i have an interface that is considerably more intuitive and natural .
because the fact that i can grab hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is considerably more natural than when i am able to make these things accessible via hierarchically organised websites or other mechanisms so to speak .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions , and so i thank you warmly for your attention and please .
i &apos;d like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
firstly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents , your curiosity is of course awakened .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteristic that can &apos;t be learned .
my objective is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , forty years of the-club-of-rome , into quality .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day you release + you release in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to absorb two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
we &apos;d only be able to float in the earth &apos;s seas as amorphous molluscs .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absorb and release phosphorus .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we are dependent on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last twenty years alone , fifteen thousand tonnes of uranium was put onto our fields in germany .
and we absorb all of it .
it causes leukemia in children .
and we think we &apos;re protecting the environment when we do a little less damage .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
protect the environment , produce less rubbish .
protect the environment , consume less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cradle to the grave , then our our entire planet will become a cemetery sooner or later .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cradle to cradle .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the ground stores over sixty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
at the moment we &apos;re growing corn and losing between eleven and thirty kilograms thirty tonnes per hectare , if you were to calculate it per square metre .
that means we &apos;re losing five-thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and everything is either the packaging or the contents .
in offenbach , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of nappies .
and as we get older , the nappies get bigger .
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-nappy stage , so to speak .
right ?
one a baby needs about six-thousand nappies .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
china can make up for that in one second .
it &apos;s entirely insignificant .
so the question is , how should we deal with nappies ?
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs .
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
because with pigs , phosphorus is released in their solid components faeces .
with people , it is released in the urine .
yes .
so humans can &apos;t be pigs .
that proves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
traditionally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and if you deny people the if you deny people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grabby and hostile .
and so you have someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , saying : there is nothing more important than stabilising the human population .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants weigh four times as much a people .
i could also mention termites , but in the usa nobody likes termites , although they &apos;re vegetarians .
so ants weigh more than we do .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
and when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offenbach , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty , right ?
you can only be climate neutral if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
that &apos;s your only chance .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
have you ?
just one single one ?
that means our entire intelligence amounts to us wanting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
you see ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
thankfully , right ?
there &apos;s no problem with overpopulation among trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon forest alone .
of those have you ever heard of overpopulation of trees ?
so all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees .
and then you see that even something like demeter , the strictest organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own metabolic waste to be returned .
every year we lose about three tonnes of phosphorus , which should really be circulated .
and so there are too many of us .
just because of that .
that means we feel so guilty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès or whatever they &apos;re all called , that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
and that means there are too many of us .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
but where are we of use ?
we try to minimize our ecological footprint , but the point is to have a big footprint that &apos;s of use .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most honourable thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
zero emissions , you see ?
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can win back our nutrients .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutrients .
this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
in in china a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is characterized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients from increasingly distance places .
that &apos;s why all western empires just kept on expanding until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imploded .
you see ?
it was different in china .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutrients .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the meal until you need to use the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you .
you were you were invited to dinner , not to steal nutrients .
that means you can see how to win back nutrients on the internet .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate biogas , on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it , raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the favelas goes down by over ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
that &apos;s high-tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
and none of these plots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fifty of them in the last twenty years , none of these plots was every sabotaged .
it would be easy to just throw a litre of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ruined for years .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most suitable purification plant is the one in frankfurt .
unfortunately not the one on offenbach , but perhaps you can give the frankfurters a hand .
because the plant in frankfurt would be the best at winning back phosphorus .
and it must go back .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we can see that it can be done .
in holland we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
the dutch government has stated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosphorus .
but we need this everywhere .
you see , there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus reservoirs worldwide .
there &apos;s the opec , a a bunch of amateurs .
it consists of twenty-six member countries that control forty percent of all the oil deposits .
and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources .
but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
so it &apos;s about effectivity , not efficiency .
in holland it &apos;s easier to understand this , because holland built the country on flowers .
you see ?
imagine your your wife is sad , because you upset her , and you turn up with fifty roses .
totally inefficient .
but totally effective , right ?
or take lipstick .
a woman in germany swallows about six point three kilos of lipstick in her lifetime .
whereas .
and that scientifically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much is kissed away .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that lipstick is totally inefficient , but very effective , you see ?
a all the beautiful things in life are inefficient .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effectivity .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
not burning the biosolids a little more , storing them and losing all the materials for the cycles in the incineration plant , but asking oneself , how do you close cycles ?
imagine mozart being efficient .
right ?
if i invite you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a pill with offenbach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yes ?
that means that everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
the whole environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environmentally aware .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
every footprint is disadvantageous there .
when you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground .
because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wetland .
not guilt management .
we say sustainability in germany .
right ?
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
what would you say ?
sustainable .
then i would say , my warm condolences , you see ?
that &apos;s just about the minimum .
so not saving , abstaining from , avoiding .
every bit of waste is a nutrient .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in italy throw out a can of coca-cola from their car window .
that &apos;s a funny occurrence , you know .
it &apos;s a type of territorial behavior , right ?
you can show that you were there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cream wrapping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
in two hours it &apos;s biodegraded , wherever it is .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful .
so two cycles are created .
of course not everything should be compostable .
a tv or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t expend them .
only things that are subject to wear and tear , such as shoe soles , brake coverings , car tyres , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
right ?
let &apos;s take sneakers for example , right ?
direct advertising , and not necessarily for the company puma , but to help this company make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
right ?
so if i invite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
positively .
so not like a detox .
there &apos;s nothing poisonous in it .
everything that &apos;s inside can be utilized .
these are the first shoes with which you make a jackrabbit start at the pedestrian lights and the rubber sole can go into biological cycles , okay ?
it &apos;s all compostable all of it .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adidas , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
and half of the wastewater problem worldwide is caused by the textile industry .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
hey , puma , do you are you really serious ?
because they changed their chairman of the board of directors twice now .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
so give me a hand here .
it is possible though .
yes .
that which i just presented to you .
it &apos;s possible .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tear , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles .
there are also technical cycles .
there &apos;s the a direct returning system for this .
it &apos;s the first biological rucksack , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
if you think about it , right ?
remember those nappies again ?
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
these nappies are everywhere practically .
in those countries where people have money .
they &apos;re on the rubbish tips , but also elsewhere in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cellulose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fifty trees in israel or tunisia with one baby .
right ?
if you just take these these nappies , shred them , sterilize them and take the powder to plant trees with it .
that makes the baby carbon-positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neutral , we can be climate-positive .
it &apos;s about making a beneficial poop print .
yes , so to speak .
right ?
we can do that .
we can re-invent things all over again .
i founded an institute with this in mind .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
there &apos;s also an extra association , the cradle-to-cradle-institute , where everybody can get involved .
so no more saving , abstaining from , avoiding , reducing , no more guilt management , but intelligent waste .
does that make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpreter .
music as language .
in the description of my presentation , it is written that i , as an interpreter , see myself as a translator , in the english sense of the word .
interpreters are translators of the written notes in resounding music .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can &apos;t just simply render a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful translation can occur .
translating from german into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the translation of literature or even poetry .
what we musicians do with our musical language is very alien to non-professionals .
as an interpreter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
now you probably think that the composer , when writing down the notes , already includes everything they &apos;ve thought of .
in reality the notes are very vague and imprecise .
these notes are about as precise or imprecise as the verbal description of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely precise .
because you can &apos;t smell the flowers in the verbal description of a landscape , you can &apos;t guess the shade of green , you can &apos;t hear or feel the whispering of the wind .
this means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audible , concrete , non-verbal musical language .
today i &apos;d like to verbally translate what i usually translate into music , or interpret .
so you could call it the translation of a translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do it all in german , because if i &apos;d have to translate it into english , that would be like the translation of the translation of the translation .
the so , music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion .
the annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language .
there are different grades here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it passively or whether you can also actively speak it , all the way to the musical native speaker .
the work of the interpreter starts off much like the work of a theatre director .
once you &apos;ve selected a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the composition &apos;s creation .
you collect information about the piece in secondary literature .
you read letters , diaries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expressed by the composer themselves .
you study works that have been composed before or after .
you make comparisons .
the reasons for writing it .
how and what did they feel ?
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
all that interests me .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period .
after a while , you already have a vast reservoir of knowledge surrounding the composer as an interpreter , and you listen to them regularly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the composer .
the composer increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
as the note is anything but a precise indication of the desire of a composer , and is , rather , a framework , i will now utilise this framework to fill it with sense and meaning .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
i play to explain what these tones might have meant .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the composer at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
every note , every phrase is thus given a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from what i &apos;ve personally experienced .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise i won &apos;t convince my audience that this is my desire .
it always makes for a happy concert when i have the fortune to experience the piece anew , even though i &apos;ve been working on it for so long in advance .
it &apos;s like experiencing a happy new day afresh , even though you go through the same rituals , getting up , having breakfast , going to work , i experience the same piece anew again and again .
i &apos;m a day older , the seasons change , my pulse is slower in the evening than it is in the morning , in a concert hall it takes longer for the reverberation to return than it does at home .
i &apos;m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
all this influences me and influences my experience of the composition .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation .
you introduce a new idea and this is answered instantaneously with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communicates in a lively way .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in twenty years .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical palette will have many more nuances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
sure , i will have thrown some colors away too , but i will have added new ones to take their place .
i have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and longstanding professor at the conservatory here in stuttgart .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already retired before i finally started studying .
but i had the good fortune to meet him at a very young age , when i was thirteen , and so i always attended his courses while i was at school .
i was seventeen when i took part in a course of his and played the last of chopin &apos;s four ballads , one of his later works .
he asked me what the preamble to this ballad was in my opinion .
it &apos;s a solemn part .
and , being young , i said , expectation .
he smiled and said , oh ?
that must be our difference in age .
because to me it means memory .
he was over sixty at the time .
well , at seventeen you still have dreams , but no significant memories .
today , i play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
another example from a very different field . monet painted his waterlilies an infinite number of times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
he translated the waterlilies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
his personal impressions of the waterlilies .
a piece of music that is interpreted for the umpteenth time is comparable in this way .
now i am also older than chopin when he wrote the piece at thirty-two .
he only lived until the age of thirty-nine .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
to maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spoken language .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
you practically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
you learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes .
when you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then tones come out , which , together , sound like music .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
beginners &apos; classes hardly talk about interpretation .
well , so it says presto at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
lento , slow .
the loud and soft symbols , f and b , etcetera .
most people here have heard of them .
but even if you implement these indications , it still just remains something technical .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
i &apos;m surprised .
i &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very elementary .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance .
which is singing .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own .
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it resonate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
people who have never sung consequently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a tone .
to form a phrase with one &apos;s own breath .
the music instrument is an extension of our own body .
we use our vocal chords to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the extensions of my fingers .
the melody is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhythm is created through dance .
the constant flooding of music today is not very beneficial there .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bored .
you no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
all one &apos;s own music is destroyed because you &apos;re constantly being bombarded by music from outside of yourself .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to properly use these little muscles that attune the vocal chords .
because you can train that .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t suitable .
then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nicely nowadays ?
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
which i would very much regret , because music is a lovely , communicative thing .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hopeless candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the taste , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t abstain from food just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t need to abstain from listening to classical music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not .
whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste .
say what you feel .
with time , you will have demands and will want to have more spices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen actively ?
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
a work of art that is never looked at will never gather the strength to have an effect .
one should eat the food that is lovingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it .
so please listen when music is played .
it is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise .
when a child grows up in an environment where the adults actively make music or at least actively listens to music , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
and it will sound completely different from before .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
instruments have developed .
there was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in bach &apos;s time .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
i think bach would have been very enthusiastic if he &apos;d had the tonal possibilities that today &apos;s modern pianos have .
i can make bach &apos;s tonal ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a baroque harpsichord was not able to .
of beethoven we know that he listened more once he &apos;d already gone deaf .
today a modern orchestra can play anything that was rejected as unplayable at the time .
that &apos;s why composers depend on us interpreters to reinvent the pieces again and again .
so that what they had only conjured up in their minds becomes listenable .
and also anything they would conjure up in their minds today .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you ever envious ?
and how did you feel ?
terrible .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
when i turn up in my little vw clunker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
something shoots through my head .
i say , ulf , why do you need such a big car ?
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s unfair .
it goes against justice .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappears .
our organism has come up with an excellent method to make unpleasant feelings like envy simply disappear .
you can also try it with words like revenge or acquisitiveness and the like .
i would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any intention of building a wall .
and then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked .
a lie like that shows you that the liar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and it &apos;s easily proven that he has something entirely different in mind .
he &apos;s only deceiving you and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re deceiving yourself .
you need this lie to keep this sham , this self-deception , upright .
this is harder to check or bring down .
you need time .
an anecdote you might know talks about this time .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once painted a portrait of a woman .
the woman then complained that the portrait didn &apos;t look anything like her .
picasso &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
it will start to look more and more like you .
at this point and if you &apos;re laughing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is conveying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
then that unpleasant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
here you have this mechanism , with which we can use the lie as a grandiose invention to stabilize our living conditions .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in folktales , folktales , in in mythology , in stories .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at herself in the mirror every day and said , who is the fairest of them all ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fairer than you .
over the hills and all that .
and you also know how much hostility arises from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political correctness here .
we need this lie here , to keep the deception upright , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and folktales , but also in science .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bishop of worcester .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
that humans are supposed to have descended from apes and that , yes , there is at least one ancestor shared by both humans and apes .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what charles has written is not true .
that the human descended from apes and we have a shared ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
because we want this self-deception , this feeling of being brilliant , descended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbearable for us .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
to show you how slowly this mechanism disappears and to illustrate the traces it leaves , which lead to something other than this grandiose image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
my wife told me it .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pupils .
an autistic pupil .
she likes him a lot , because he has the tendency to be forthright .
and she asked him , so what are your hobbies ?
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire brigade .
and because i &apos;m with the fire brigade , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire brigade , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sentence .
a young lad like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fires .
he &apos;s interested in setting fires .
but there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire brigade .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
and moreover , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for removing the danger that others create when they set a fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this this hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out loud .
here you have the censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which switches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness .
we know that something else is really true .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
according to which logic do we disseminate this deception , this self-deception , this willingness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ?
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illustrate this .
the first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
i &apos;m talking about the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something mental , leibniz said .
it does not have a tangible , material nature .
and when you are with people who are firmly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an incorporeal framework around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of flesh and blood , are solid , so to speak , bound to the earth , ephemeral , subject to decay , insignificant , dead really .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an airy nature , it &apos;s called anima in latin , being like a breath of air .
and when this breath of air pours out onto a human , the human is filled with dignity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul .
and then it can leave you .
that &apos;s how people imagine the soul works .
that it comes to the human from outside .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
because now you can implement a rule of three .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
this is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
you &apos;ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie .
namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way .
this rule of three contains three theorems .
the first theorem is , klaus claims there is no soul .
the second theorem is thus , if klaus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now we have the third theorem .
i highlighted it here .
a third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
so you sense it already .
here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse .
you see it straight away .
the first two theorems are logically correct .
i can claim anything .
logic does not make any statements about reality .
i can say , the german chancellor is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chancellor is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chancellor is not a man .
logic does not make any statement about what is valid .
i can claim anything .
what is decisive , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s valid .
so when klaus says , there is no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
so it attaches a third theorem to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theorems and only acts as if the opposite of the first theorem had already been proven and given priority .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
but with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theorems are logically correct and attaches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can apply these things to other examples .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers .
here you have to keep another philosophical theme , a philosophical slow-burner , close to hand .
that has to do with us going back to the fourteenth
century .
there was a scholar called jean buridan , and buridan &apos;s ass was named after him .
buridan &apos;s ass is an ass that is made purely of nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
and if you put it exactly between two equally big haystacks , it will starve .
because it doesn &apos;t know which haystack it should go to first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imagined .
two equally large forces with opposite signsnatures will cancel each other out .
nothing will happen .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one haystack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
he &apos;ll automatically go to the right thought .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determined by the larger haystack that immediately attracts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and as we &apos;re here in frankfurt am main , i &apos;ll remind you of the max -planck-institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a scholar there , his name is wolf singer , and sometimes people say , wolf singer claims , there is no free will .
now we can come up with the second theorem and say : if wolf singer is right , then he has no free will .
these theorems are absolutely logical and correct .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind .
here you have it again .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
but the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theorem were false from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any proof .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predictors .
and don &apos;t use the german word for predictors , which would be prophet .
you mustn &apos;t say that , because that would be a little politically incorrect .
say , there are no predictors .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predictors , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
because while you are busy telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predictors , your counterpart will be very happy .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s deceived you .
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the necessity to prove that there are predictors .
so through this mode of passing on the burden of proving something you are experiencing the brilliance of the lie .
and if you have another opportunity to enact this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don &apos;t remind them of their self-deception .
thank you for your attention .
yes , hello .
i took the liberty i asked lilly , if it would be okay to mention her .
she &apos;s one of the organizers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea .
i must honestly say , and you witnessed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
i probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , i probably belong to the generation that created this bad ecological image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in karlsruhe in nineteen seventy nine , i think it &apos;s called kit today .
and then i went to berlin in the mid-eighties because i wanted to study renewable energies and they didn &apos;t have that in karlsruhe .
there was the leopoldshafen nuclear research plant .
they were all called kfas at the time , the place in jülich was also called a kfa .
today they &apos;re called project executing organizations .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
but something stupid like a solar pendulum , which has an output of something like one hundred watt per square metre , that was a toy .
and in berlin there was this crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful to the person behind premium cola that he rehabilitated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything left-wing was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the eighties .
at that time , there were self-governing companies and one of them was in kreuzberg in mehringhof , where people thought evil took place .
a terrorist place , but it was was called wuseltronik and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mid-eighties .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statements were made , which i also was part of .
i worked in the collective for eleven years , it was based on a grassroots democracy .
we were a group of twenty people .
if one person said no , there was the veto principle , which was totally demoralising , for ten years , i i had grave doubts as to whether i was perhaps really wasting my great engineering degree on something ridiculous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wasted your money on your child .
he &apos;s wasting his time on nonsense .
and that was really very , very bitter and then you end up in one of these phases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutschmark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
and then i stuck to it until nineteen ninety six and then i became the co-founder of the company solon together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufacturers in the world together with the spin-off q-cells .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this nonsense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about storage .
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introduce to you .
the title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renewable energies .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could implement a reservoir wisely today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island graciosa on azores .
yes , here is the data .
four and a half thousand people live there .
they have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because technologically it &apos;s just not possible .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in berlin-adlershof .
they then also say , why ?
we have twenty percent in germany .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the european one .
if we had twenty percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
the question is just , calculate that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to twenty , thirty , forty , fifty , maybe even seventy percent renewable energies .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about one hundred gigawatts electrical output on diesel fuel basis is added in the world per year .
that &apos;s equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is relieved with diesel fuel , because you don &apos;t need a license for it .
it goes fast .
you put a box like this over there .
and that generally looks like this .
in it , there are always three diesels running , two are always maintained .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
we were given very accurate data .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back-up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quantities .
our objective was to simply say , okay ,
the diesel will be the back-up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
and if you want to exceed twenty , thirty percent renewable energies , you have to switch off diesel .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energies can take over the entire network .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your shaving machine in the car via a small power inverter .
people always ask me , what are you researching in adlershof all the time ?
that is doable .
but if you want to hook up several of these power inverters and they are supposed to construct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
and our aim was , we wanted to reach seventy to ninety percent renewable energies and then this remainder is still here , the last remainder , the last ten , twenty percent renewable energies with , that will will be very , very expensive and generating this from batteries won &apos;t work either .
that will definitely be an energy carrier which will be hydrogen methane , power to gas you know alr , that &apos;s what it will be .
you will then rather have to go to a seasonal reservoir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run-of-the-mill electrochemical battery .
how far would you get with that ?
and then we tried out a whole load of simulations .
and we simulated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fifty cents per kwh after twenty years , you &apos;d arrive at about forty-four cents .
those were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay ,
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the diesel system , if the price of diesel rises by five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the islanders .
what needed to be done ?
we negotiated with investors , i looked for new shareholders .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the organisation .
and here you have the graphic again .
the brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
and the power utility , which which the electric utility on the island , said they think it &apos;s great .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
and funnily enough it was developed at the bbc mannheim , called abb today , in the seventies , and was then licensed to the japanese .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
and then presented .
we also brought one of these diesel aggregates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the converters , with which we simulate the network .
over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system , the cable &apos;s kilometer physics , to illustrate the vibration behavior , so to speak , in the network .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
we can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network .
we can see it again here we can see the diesel again here , and all the individual aggregates here .
and what we did , the hall was completed in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and twelve , we developed practically everything that could be developed electronically and in terms of software between the individual systems .
so we &apos;re not battery manufacturers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
you have to be able to cater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
the nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anticipate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renewable energies .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty-five-thirty percent excess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun .
of course this lends itself to a smart grid .
smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
we can start integrating electro-mobility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
that means that if you &apos;re at seventy percent renewable energies , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reservoir .
you can heed the share by using one of these smart grids , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &apos;ll never be able to do without the reservoir completely .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise .
if we turn off the diesel , then you will no longer have this rotating mass , which causes a certain amount of idleness in the network .
and our european energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants , where the axle always revolves around the whole of europe .
we look into this network , see the fifty hertz , and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz , we start to open a few small valves , then a little more steam can enter , and then it goes up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
and in that time you can react differently .
if you don &apos;t have this rotating mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electronics and electro-chemistry .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc .
and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network .
must-run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequency .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , additional construction of coal-burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas turbines , because that &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capacities , the must-run capacities , by putting electrochemical reservoirs in the network too .
thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experimental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
and yes , the discussion always revolves around how much of the future you can anticipate .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thirty years regarding photovoltaics .
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s nonsense , a plaything for kids , we calculated everything , it will never add up .
we have thirty gigawatt of photo-voltaic power in germany .
that &apos;s exemplary .
and i simply assume that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electrochemical reservoirs in the whole world for the next thirty years .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
there will be a whole load of resistance and arguments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been joining my side in the last couple of years .
we &apos;ve been given over ten million funded projects , also to attach a ten-megawatt battery to the german network .
that will take place next april .
so you &apos;re noticing a change is taking place , from a defensive attitude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renewable energies is right .
and when you have one hundred percent renewable energies , then it &apos;s like a self-sufficient system .
up till now the following is always argued in discussions , these islanders are becoming self-sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are drilled out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
and that is kind of our vision of sensible energy use and i am grateful to the cradle to cradle institute that they said , use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and so in this sense we &apos;re coming together , also if you look at the presentation by premium cola , that it &apos;s okay to be a collective and use solar power .
and yes , well , i &apos;d just like to motivate you , in the sense that it &apos;s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty firm while doing so , but i think it &apos;s it &apos;s possible .
thank you .
